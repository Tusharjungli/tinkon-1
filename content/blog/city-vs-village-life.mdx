## My Two Worlds: Between Village Mud and City Malls

I was born in the city.  
But I was *raised* in the village.

At least, that’s what it felt like every summer.  
We’d leave behind the noisy streets, the AC-cooled rooms, the rush of deadlines — and step into a world where time moved slower, people looked you in the eye, and life was... real.

This blog isn’t about “rural is better.”  
It’s about what we’re losing. Especially for kids who’ve only ever known a screen.

## Waking Up With Nature, Not Notifications

In the village, the morning isn’t digital. It starts with the sound of cows, roosters, and wind. You open your eyes to sunlight slipping through trees, not blue light from a screen.

I still remember walking barefoot to the well with my cousins, brushing our teeth with neem sticks, laughing at nothing. No rush. No filters. Just a slow, sacred start to the day.

## Comfort Isn't Always Connection

Sure, the city has everything: Zomato, Alexa, Netflix. But what’s the cost?

People pay lakhs for “nature-themed resorts” that mimic what villages offer for free — fresh food, silence, open space, and real human company.

Cities teach us to rely on things.  
Villages teach us to rely on people.

## Community Is Not an App

In my village, the neighbors aren’t strangers. They’re your extended family, your emergency contact, your evening tea circle.

In the city, you live next to someone for five years and still don’t know their last name.

Kids in villages grow up being watched, guided, and scolded by *everyone*. It’s annoying. It’s also beautiful.

## Pets? No, They’re Family

Dogs. Cows. Buffaloes. Chickens.

These aren’t “domesticated animals” in the village. They’re part of your day. You grow up feeding them, talking to them, sometimes even sleeping next to them. That bond is hard to explain to someone whose only pet experience is on Instagram reels.

---

## Festivals Without Hashtags

In the city, festivals are a long weekend, a few fairy lights, and 20 Instagram stories.  
In the village, they’re a feeling.

They take over the street. The sweets are homemade. People visit without texting first. There’s music, chaos, color — and it’s all real.

## Getting Dirty Was the Point

City parents yell: “Don’t get dirty!”

Village parents shrug: “Wash your hands later.”

We ran in mud, climbed trees, stole mangoes, and came home bruised and proud. There was no "playdate" — life itself was play. Every field was a cricket pitch. Every street had a story.

---

## A Story I’ll Never Forget

One summer, my little cousin — city born, iPad raised — visited our village. When he saw someone drinking rainwater, he gasped. “That’s dirty!”

He refused to step on mud. Didn’t want to feed cows. And kept asking for WiFi.

I wasn’t angry. Just sad.  
It wasn’t his fault. He just never got the chance to live this way.

## City Kids Learn Screens. Village Kids Learn Life.

Modern childhood is structured, safe, and supervised.  
But freedom teaches better lessons.

- In the village, you fall and figure it out.  
- You borrow, share, trade, fix, hustle.  
- You learn from your environment, not just a classroom.

That’s why I believe village life makes you *emotionally strong*. Not just “book smart”.

## What I Miss Today

I live in the city now. I work on screens. I have my comforts.  
But when I feel burnt out, anxious, or uninspired, I remember the village.

That breath of fresh air at dawn.  
That dusty field after rain.  
That random knock on the door from someone who just wanted to chat.

No notification can replace that.

## If I Could Redesign Childhood...

Every kid would spend a summer in a village.

No gadgets. No English coaching.  
Just mud, mangoes, cows, chaos, and people who know you—not your username.

Because **what city kids are missing isn’t just fresh air.  
They’re missing the joy of unfiltered life.**

---

## Final Thought

It’s easy to forget where we come from.  
But if you’ve ever walked barefoot through a village path, sat under a tree with your cousins, or eaten a mango fresh off the branch — you know.

You know that kind of happiness can’t be bought.  
It’s lived. And it stays with you, even years later, even in the city.

**Did you grow up in a village? Or wish you had? Share your story below — I’d love to hear it.**  
And if you’re raising kids today, give them a taste of that wild, raw freedom. It’ll shape them forever.
