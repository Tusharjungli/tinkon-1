But when I read this part, it feels like destiny snatch one more thing from Maryadapurushottam Ram.*

## The Moment Before the Storm

One day Lakshman was in the forest gathering fruits and Ram sat near Sita preparing a garland of flowers.  
Ram gently told Sita:

> I am going deeper into the forest to destroy some demons.  
Until I come back, it’s better if you do not stay in your original form.

According to Tulsidas, **Sita performed an Agni-Samadhi**, leaving behind her *Maya roop*.  
But personally, I think it was symbolic.  
Maybe she **changed how she looked** so no one could identify her.  
A lesson: sometimes survival is not strength, but strategy.

## The Golden Deer

Far away, Ravana reached the ocean shore and met **Maarich**, peacefully.  
He told him about Surpanakha’s humiliation and requested help.

Maarich refused:
> Ram is not ordinary.  
> He threw me thousands of feet with one arrow when he was a child.  
> He killed Tadka and now Khar & Dushan with thousands of warriors.  
> Don’t make this mistake.

But Ravana threatened him with death.  
So Maarich agreed, choosing death from Ram over death from Ravana.

He transformed into a **beautiful golden deer** near Panchvati.

Sita saw Deer(marrich) first and was mesmerized:
> How beautiful. I want this. Please bring it.

Ram could not deny her.  
He asked Lakshman to protect her and ran after the deer.

The deer played tricks, running deeper into the forest.  
Finally Ram shot him, and while dying Maarich **screamed in Ram’s voice**:

> Lakshman! Lakshman!

## The Breaking Point

Sita heard the scream and panicked.  
She ordered Lakshman to go check.

Lakshman tried to calm her:
> No power can hurt Ram.  
This cry is deception.

But Sita spoke harsh words and Lakshman’s heart broke.  
He created a protective **Lakshman Rekha**, warned her not to cross it,  
and left to find Ram.

Ravana watched everything and saw his chance.

He changed into a sage and approached Sita.

Sita offered him fruits and water, but he revealed his true form:

> I am Ravana, King of Lanka.  
Come with me or see my wrath.

Sita rejected him.  
Enraged, he lifted her into his chariot and **flew through the sky**(Rode his chariot that looks like he was flying).  
Sita screamed **Ram! Lakshman!** and cursed her own decision.

## The Battle of Jatayu

The old eagle king **Jatayu** saw Ravana taking Sita.  
He attacked fiercely, ripping Ravana’s hair and pushing him to the ground.

Jatayu protected Sita and fought until Ravana, desperate, used his sword  
and **cut Jatayu’s wings**.

Jatayu fell bleeding and Ravana escaped.

On the way, Sita dropped her ornaments piece by piece, hoping someone would see.

Destiny played his game and some monkeys from mountain top saw a lady crying.

Ravana took her to Lanka and placed her in the **Ashoka Vatika**,  
surrounded by guards.

---

## The Grief of Ram

Ram saw Lakshman returning and asked why he left Sita.  
Then they spoke no more and ran to the hut, but **Sita was gone**.

Searching through the forest, they found **Jatayu dying**.  
Ram held him gently:

> Tell my father nothing about Sita when you meet him in heaven.  
> If I am truly Rama, I will send Ravana there myself.

Jatayu died in Ram’s arms.  
Ram performed his final rites with his own hands.  
No king ever honored a soldier like that.

## Shabri and the Way Forward

Moving forward, Ram killed the demon **Kabandh** and reached **Shabri’s Ashram**.

Shabri had waited her whole life for him.  
She washed their feet, served berries with love, and shared 9 teachings:

1. Satsang of saints  
2. Listening to spiritual stories  
3. Serving without ego  
4. Let go of sin, chant Ram’s name  
5. Unbreakable faith  
6. Control senses  
7. See everyone equally  
8. Leave greed  
9. Simple living, pure heart

Ram asked her about Sita.  
Shabri told him to go to **Pampa Lake** where he would meet **Sugreev**.

## The Journey 

On the way, animals were running and crying, as if saying:
> Don’t leave your love again.

The forest grew dark and beautiful, with birds and animals following them.

Ram told Lakshman:
> Lust, anger and greed destroy humans.  
They are the strongest enemies living inside you.

Finally, they reached Pampa Lake, bathed and rested under a tree.

And there, **the war truly began**.

## ✨ Reflection

> For Tulsidas, this chapter was destiny.  
> For me, it is a reminder that sometimes the breaking of a heart becomes the birth of purpose.

## End of Aranya Kand

Ram lost Sita… but found the path that would shake the world.  
Jatayu died… but became immortal.  
Lakshman cried… but became stronger.  

And the forest waited for the storm named Lanka.
