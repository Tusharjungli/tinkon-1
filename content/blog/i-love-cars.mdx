I don't need a love story. I need a good road, a full tank, and an excuse to drive at midnight. I just need a moody playlist while I sit with my thoughts in my car. Actually, cars nowadays are a great way to escape the world. You roll up the windows and no one can hear you, nor can you hear anyone. Comfortable seats with good music connect you with yourself. Gen Z like me especially enjoy this during nighttime, and it's even better when the weather is cloudy.

## How It All Started: Grease, Gears & Childhood

My love for cars began when I was old enough to explore this world. At 10, I remember my father had a garage where he and his mechanics with grease-stained hands repaired Ambassador cars. There were various vehicles like Maruti 800, Alto, Esteem, and old open-roof jeeps. When they finished working in the evening, I would sneak into the garage to play with the steering wheel and shift gears without keys, imagining I was flying.

I begged my father to teach me how to drive, but he never did. I learned through trial and error instead. He was always worried about his vehicles. As I grew older, my father's responsibilities increased while his automobile business declined. By the time I was 16, he had to completely shut down the business, and my memories about cars began to fade. My father turned to farming, and I became trapped in studies (which never benefited me much).

## Rediscovering My Passion

This passion for cars revived when I entered college and saw students arriving in modified cars with heavy bass systems, custom wheels, and tinted windows. This was just the beginning. Then I discovered the Fast and Furious movie series, which showed me that cars aren't just vehicles—they're emotional connections for people, especially men. I didn't fully understand this until I sat behind the wheel myself.

After my father's business failure, he never wanted me to pursue anything related to the car industry. But I'm stubborn. Since childhood, I've seen that cars are truly emotional machines. In college, I wasn't learning about cars themselves—I was learning about the emotions attached to them. I knew many students drove cars just to show off.

## Learning the Language of Cars

During this time, I began exploring cars more deeply. I started reading about horsepower, torque, wheelbase, steering, and other basic automotive concepts. One of the few useful things school taught me in physics class was about torque, and this was when I genuinely understood it practically in relation to cars. In simple terms, it's the perpendicular force produced by a car. If I had to explain the difference between torque and horsepower to a 10-year-old: horsepower is how hard you hit a wall at full speed, while torque is how far you push that wall after hitting it.

I understood these concepts well in college, and by graduation, I had basic knowledge about cars. To truly understand and experience them, I needed to sit inside one, observe someone driving, and then drive myself. I got this opportunity during a mountain trip where we had a car accident. What better way to learn about cars than through a breakdown? For the rest of the trip, we drove a damaged car, and I learned more about vehicles than I might have through other means. That's why I believe failure is the best teacher—nothing teaches you what failure can.

## The YouTube Era: From F1 to Engine Obsession

After that experience, my passion for cars intensified. My YouTube feed filled with supercars, engine specifications, and automotive technology. Recently, I've been watching Formula 1, which is fundamentally about car engineering—that's what makes it so fascinating. The more I learn about F1 car design, the deeper I fall into this world. It's amazing.

Some people (mostly women in my life) never understand how someone can love a machine. I've seen people meticulously clean their cars while their rooms remain a mess—their cars are their first priority. Then there are "engine people" whose cars might not look impressive from the outside, but they love what's under the hood. They enjoy racing and tinkering with engines rather than focusing on appearance. There are different types of people with different expressions of love for their cars.

## My Own Car Story: The Interview and Beyond

Let me share a recent example. During one of my MBA interviews, I told the interviewer I was a car enthusiast because my father had an automobile business—that's where my passion began. Then came the cross-examination. She asked me which was the second-biggest car company situated in North India. I gave the answer, but in my mind I was thinking, "I told you I'm a car enthusiast, not a general knowledge enthusiast. You could ask me anything about cars from interior to exterior." That's what I mean about being a car enthusiast. Loving cars doesn't mean I know general knowledge about car factories. I know about cars themselves—their engines, gears, RPM, tech features, and so on.

Although I'm still hustling and don't have enough money for a high-end car, my passion remains strong with my middle-class vehicle. I love experimenting with it—trying drifting, testing engine performance at peak levels, and occasionally pushing high speeds on highways. I even test my adrenaline rush at high speeds. The experience at peak performance is incredibly smooth. My favorite hobby is driving alone on highways late at night with my favorite playlist, surrounded by just my thoughts and memories. Sometimes during these drives, I push my car to its limits and take risks.

## Why Learning to Drive Is All About Failure

Learning to drive is probably the fastest skill I've ever picked up through failure. I failed, regretted it, then drove again. When driving, you must be completely focused on everything around you—side mirrors, rear mirrors, roads, vehicles, and many other elements. I mastered this much faster than I expected. As I mentioned, my father didn't help me learn to drive. I simply took the car keys and, despite some initial fear, drove onto the road. Through patience, failures, and practice, I learned to drive perfectly in quickly. That's why I always love failure—[failure is mother of all teachers](/blog/failing-everything).

## Car Dreams, Car Culture

I love seeing modified cars, V8 engines, turbochargers, gear shifters, and 4-wheel drive vehicles. My dream car is a Porsche. I love their minimalist, aesthetic design where everything is so clean yet powerful. I'm especially fond of the launch control feature. I experienced it just once in a Porsche 911, and since then, I've been a devoted fan. I'm certain that I'll purchase a Porsche someday. Besides Porsche, I also love BMW and Ford cars. 

I want to push my limits just like I do with cars. I want to revive my father's automobile business again. I started this mission 6 months ago and I'm still working on it. It's a big project, and I'm tackling it alone. I want to rebuild the same garage that my father started—the one that ultimately failed—but this time with purpose and proper structure. This requires significant effort and funding, but it will be worth it. This will be my gift to my father.

## F1 Tech: The Future Under the Hood

The tech in cars is on the next level and you know one secret: Formula 1 is basically a project mission, not just a car championship. This mission pushes the limits of physics, tech, and cars. The technology they are using is, in some way, integrated into modern cars. Like the paddle shifters are from Formula 1. The front and rear cameras, traction control, even air pressure sensors—all of these came from F1.

## Manual vs. Automatic: My Favourite Debate

Now, let's discuss manual versus automatic cars. This is my favorite topic, and I'm confident I can make a compelling case for manual transmissions. Having driven manual cars from the beginning, I believe nothing compares to them. Despite innovations like IMT, double clutch, and automatic transmissions, manual cars offer unparalleled control. You can change gears at your own pace, push performance limits, monitor RPM, and assess engine performance directly. In racing scenarios, manual transmissions often provide a competitive edge that automatics can't match. I could discuss manual cars for hours, but I'll remember this is a general car blog, not specifically about the manual versus automatic debate.

## Diesel, Petrol, or Electric? My Take

Another major debate in the automotive world is petrol/diesel cars versus electric. For me, all three are distinct categories with their own merits. I started with diesel cars, which remain my favorites because of their heavy-duty engines with lasting power. They feel nostalgic and powerful to me. My second preference is petrol engines, which are lighter and provide instant acceleration—like being in a car-shaped rollercoaster.

Electric engines come last in my ranking, perhaps because I've never driven an electric car. I believe they still lag behind traditional combustion engines for two main reasons. First is the charging issue: with conventional cars, you visit a petrol station, pay, fill up, and leave within 10 minutes. With electric vehicles, you must spend time charging—I've observed a minimum of 45 minutes to charge from 0-60%. Second, electric cars lack that satisfying roar or the visceral feeling of driving with a combustion engine. They simply don't evoke the same emotional response.

Overall, I don't connect with electric cars the same way. I enjoy driving while hearing the engine's noise, and I want to experience these petrol/diesel engines while I still can. I recognize that these traditional cars will eventually disappear, leaving only electric vehicles on our roads.

## Why I’ll Always Love Cars

In conclusion, I deeply love cars, and perhaps you do too—that's why you're here reading this. The soothing sound of raindrops hitting the car while the wipers move across the windshield is truly mesmerizing. I especially cherish driving alone in the rain. My passion for cars grows stronger each day, and writing this blog has only intensified my love for these magnificent machines.
