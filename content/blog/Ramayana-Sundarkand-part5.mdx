When even the ocean is forced to listen.*

## Refuge Under Ram

When Vibhishan finally stood before Ram and Lakshman,  
he folded his hands and said:

> Ravana has betrayed me.  
> His ego has blinded him.  
> I seek refuge under you.

Without hesitation, Ram embraced him.

Lakshman remained alert, bow ready.  
cautious.

Ram gestured gently:

> Do not worry.

Vibhishan spoke about Lanka and about Lanka's defenses.  
Ram listened and taught him quietly, side by side.

Vibhishan bowed and said:

> Living among demons made me forget who I was.  
> You gave me a new life.

Ram replied:

> You were never lost.  
> You only needed remembrance.

### ✨ Reflection

> Acceptance is not weakness.  
> Sometimes it is the highest form of strength.

## A Place in Heart

Before the monkey army, Ram performed rituals with ocean water  
and gave Vibhishan a place in his army.

Balance had arrived.

With Vibhishan’s knowledge of Lanka,  
the impossible began to feel possible.

Ram then asked:

> How do we cross this ocean?

Suggestions followed.

Lakshman spoke sharply:

> Destroy everything in the ocean and walk through it.

Ram answered:

> Patience.

## Ravana Laughs

Ravana sent spies disguised as monkeys.  
They were quickly exposed and captured.

Lakshman laughed and spared them.
As they were just messangers and Lakshman was not as cruel as Ravana.

He sent a message:

> Return Sita,  
> and meet Ram as soon as possible.

In Lanka, Ravana mocked the warning.

He cursed Ram, the monkeys and even the ocean.

But when messengers described the army,  
their voices trembled.

They spoke of Hanuman,  
of Sugreev,  
of countless vanaras and bears.

They said:

> Ram stands above them all.

Ravana laughed again.  
Ego blinds him.

## When Ram get angry

Days passed.

No path appeared.

Ram grew restless.

Like Lakshman, anger rose within him.

He climbed a mountain, lifted his bow,  
and the ocean trembled.

Creatures fled.  
Waves shook.

Just before destruction,  
a sage rose from the waters and pleaded:

> Do not destroy countless lives to save one.  
> Order me anything, but spare them.

Ram lowered his bow.

> Show me a way to cross this ocean.

---


## The Path

The sage spoke:

> Nal and Neer are with you.  
> They are engineers born for this moment.

Ram waited.

As the tide lowered,  
a plan took shape.

A bridge.  
Strong enough for elephants.  
Wide enough for armies.  
Safe enough for everyone.

Under Ram’s guidance,  
Nal and Neer began the work.

Stone by stone.  
Name by name.

And with that,  
the purpose of Sundar Kand was complete.

## End of Sundar Kand

Even the ocean must bow  
when truth stands firm and patient.

Thank you for walking through Sundar Kand with me.

See you at Lanka Kand.
