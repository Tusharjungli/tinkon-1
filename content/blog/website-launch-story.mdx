## 🎯 Why I Started This Blog (and Why It’s Called *Tinkon*)

Let’s start with the name.  
“Tinkon” is a messy, made-up cocktail of:

- “Tushar”  
- “Tinker”  
- “Think On” (because I overthink *everything*)

It’s personal. It’s weird. It’s me.  
And that’s the energy I wanted this site to carry.

## 🧨 Before the Code: My Life Was Glitching

Two years after graduation, my resume read like a tragic comedy:  
❌ Failed MBA attempts  
❌ Certifications that led nowhere  
❌ Short-term wins, long-term confusion

I wasn’t just jobless. I was hope-less.  
Especially as the eldest son in a desi household.  
They don’t teach you this in school: **failing silently hurts more than failing publicly.**

So I did what I always do when I break down—I started tinkering.

## 💻 The First Step Wasn’t Code (It Was Color Palettes)

Oddly enough, I didn’t open VS Code first. I opened Pinterest.

Fonts. Colors. Layouts.  
I spent days designing a vibe before I even knew what the homepage would say.

Why? Because I wanted this blog to feel *safe*—not corporate, not flashy.  
Just soft, clean, and quiet. Like a cafe inside my brain.

## 😅 My Funniest Dev Fail (That I’ll Never Forget)

After two full days of “hustling,” I proudly pushed to GitHub.  
Deployed it. Waited for magic.  
…Nothing happened.

Turns out—I was pushing to the **wrong repo the entire time**.  
I laughed, cried, and made coffee. In that order.

## 😰 The Hardest Part Wasn’t Tech. It Was *Publishing Myself*

You can debug an error.  
You can’t debug self-doubt.

As an introvert, sharing my thoughts online was the scariest part.  
“Who am I to say anything?”  
“Will anyone even read this?”  
“What if I’m just not enough?”

But I hit publish anyway.  
And that one click made me feel like I’d reclaimed my narrative.

## 🐶 My Golden Retriever Was My Silent Co-founder

Some nights, my Golden Retriever would sit beside me—tail wagging, eyes curious, occasionally putting his paw on my keyboard like, “Bro, chill.”

He reminded me that peace exists outside the screen.  
He’s the only being who didn’t care about perfect layout or SEO. He just wanted snacks and love.

Without him, I’d have burnt out.  
With him, I built something human.

## 🌱 What I Want *Tinkon* to Be

Not just a blog. Not a portfolio.  
A *place*—for raw stories, unfiltered failures, quiet thoughts.  

If you’ve ever felt behind in life…  
If you’re tired of perfect posts and loud people…  
If you just want to *be heard*—you’ll feel safe here.

## 🕰️ Advice to My Younger Self

> You’re allowed to take your time.  
> You’re allowed to fail.  
> You’re allowed to rebuild.  
> You don’t owe the world perfection—you owe yourself peace.

## ✨ Final Thought

> I didn’t build this site to impress anyone.  
> I built it to survive my own storm.

And if sharing it helps even one person feel a little less alone—then every bug, every breakdown, every repo mistake was worth it.
