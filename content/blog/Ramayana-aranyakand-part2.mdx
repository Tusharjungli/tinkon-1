> *Lakshman once asked Ram: “What is Maya?”  
> And Ram answered: “Me, mine, myself — these illusions are the walls that trap the soul.”*

That’s the wisdom Krishna later gave to Arjuna.  
Different yuga, same truth.

## The Arrival of Surpanakha

Days passed peacefully in Panchvati  
until one afternoon **Surpanakha**(sister of Ravana), arrived.

Tulsidas writes about her like a venomous serpent.  
She saw Ram… and lost in Ram.. 
she wants to marry him.

She transformed her wild devil form into a beautiful woman and walked towards Ram.

She said:
> You are the only one like you.  
> I am the only one like me.  
> So marry me.

Ram looked at Sita… and smiled.

He replied:
> I am already married. You can ask my brother Lakshman.

Surpanakha ran to Lakshman.  
Lakshman replied:
> I am only a servant of Shri Ram. And I am already married.

Insulted, she turned back to Ram again.  
Ram redirected her again to Lakshman.  
And finally, she frustrated of this game.

She dropped her disguise.  
Her face turned monstrous.  
Her harsh voice shook the forest.

Seeing this Sita terrified, Ram signaled Lakshman only through his eyes.

And in one sharp moment with sword...
**Lakshman cut her nose and ears.**

Blood everywhere. Surpanakha Screams so loud.  
That’s sound announced the fire of war.

## Khar and Dushan Enter the Battlefield

Surpanakha ran to her brothers **Khar and Dushan**, furious and humiliated.

She provoked them until they lost control:
> You are not men. You let someone carve my face and sit here laughing.

Soon a massive army appeared with Khar and Dushan for revenge.
demons coming by sky, by earth,
shouting cursing words, threatening to take Sita,  
to kill Ram and Lakshman and to destroy Panchvati.

Ram saw the army approaching and he instructed Lakshman:
> Take Sita and hide deep in the valley. Protect her.

Lakshman took Sita away.  
Ram tied his hair, lifted his bow and smiled gently.
That's what i call real Aura.

## The War That Shook Panchvati

When the devils saw Ram closely, they froze.  
His divine beauty made them tremble.

They whispered:
> If he looks like this, imagine how beautiful his wife is.

Khar ordered:
> Capture Sita. Leave these two alive.

Ram responded:
> We are Kshatriya. We protect sages.  
> We bend to no evil. Fight us if you dare.

And then it began.

Ram’s first arrow tore the sky like thunder.  
Bodies flew. Heads rolled.  
Blood covered the ground.  
Animals ate the flesh of demons.  
The forest turned red.

Ghosts rising after death, eating each other.  
Bones cracking. Screams echoing.

It was war in its rawest form and
Ram fighting alone against thousands.

Khar and Dushan screamed:
> Anyone who runs will die by our hands!

But they could not stop death.

In the end. silence.  
Ram stood alone, breathing strongly, body full in blood.

Lakshman returned with Sita.  
Sita was shaken seeing Ram covered in blood.  
But she understood why sometimes it needs violence.

## Surpanakha Reaches Ravana

Surpanakha reached Lanka covered in blood, screaming.

Ravana grabbed her and asked:
> Who did this to you?

She said:
> Two young warriors in Panchvati.  
> One is Ram powerful like death itself.  
> And his brother Lakshman cut my nose.

She exaggerated, cried with twisted words.
She added:
> When I said I am sister of Ravana, both laughed at me.

That night **Ravana did not sleep**.

Thinking. Burning. Planning.

The thought that someone existed whom he could not control  
tortured him beyond ego.

And the image of **Sita** became his obsession.

> He decided: I will kill them and take Ram's wife.

Ravana prepared his chariot same night 
and flew to meet **Marich**.

### ✨ Reflection

> For Tulsidas, this battle was the first spark of a storm.  
> For me, it is the moment where a human about to destroy whole dynasty.

Because some wars are forced by fate.

This chapter changes the tone of Ramayana forever.  
What began as exile now turns into war.

In the next part:  
**Ravana meets Marich.**  
**The golden deer.**
