> *Some friendships are written by destiny.  
Some are born in fire and fear.  
Ram and Hanuman’s friendhsip began with a question*

---

## The Mountain of Exiles

Ram and Lakshman reached **Rishyamuk Mountain**, unaware that the greatest devotee of Ram was about to meet him for the first time.

Sugreev saw them from afar
two young men, broad shoulders, steady walk, warrior presence.

To him its danger.

To us its destiny.

He immediately told Hanuman:

> "Go. Find out who they are.  
If they are Bali’s people, signal me.  
If they are not, I’ll come out."

And that was the moment Hanuman walked towards Ram  
in the disguise of a simple sage.

---

## The First Conversation

Hanuman asked gently:

> "Why are you here, strangers?  
Men like you should be in kingdoms, not deep forests.  
Are you warriors, gods or wanderers?"

Ram smiled and replied:

> "We are sons of King Dashrath.  
We are living in exile because of my father’s promise.  
And a demon stole my wife.  
We are searching for her."

The moment Hanuman heard this, something clicked inside him.  
He had heard of this Ram.  
He had heard of his strength.  
His calmness.  
His divine nature.

This wasn’t just any prince.  
This was *the Ram*.

Hanuman touched Ram’s feet, ashamed for questioning him.

Ram gently lifted him and said:

> "Don’t be ashamed.  
To me, you are like Lakshman."

Even Tulsidas wrote it with pride.  
And reading it feels like the moment when two souls recognize each other without introduction.

## Hanuman Reveals Himself

Hanuman returned to his true form  
a mighty warrior, a vanar of immense power.

He took Ram and Lakshman on his back  
and climbed to the peak where Sugreev lived.

And Sugreev who was tired, scared and broken finally met the one person who could change his destiny.

But friendship doesn't always happen naturally.  
Sometimes it needs a push.  
That push was Hanuman.

---

## The Pact of Friendship

Hanuman sat both of them near a fire  
and made them share their stories.

Sugreev said:

> "I found a piece of cloth belonging to Sita.  
I heard someone crying ‘Ram... Ram’ in the forest."

Ram held the cloth close to his heart.  
Smelled it.  
Felt it.
 
And honestly, imagining someone smelling the last memory of their loved one 
it hits differently.

Sugreev then said:

> "I will help you find her… but I’m hiding from Bali."

Ram asked why.

What followed was a story of betrayal, fear and pain.

---

## Sugreev’s Trauma

Sugreev told Ram about the magical cave  
about waiting for Bali  
about seeing blood flow out  
about assuming Bali was dead  
about becoming king  
about Bali returning  
about Bali assuming Sugreev betrayed him  
about losing his wife  
about losing his kingdom  
about running ever since.

Ram heard everything.


He said:

> "If I call someone my friend, I protect them.  
I will kill Bali for you."

That one promise is what changed Kishkindha forever.

---

## Testing Ram’s Strength

Sugreev still doubted.

So he showed Ram giant bones of demons Bali defeated.  
Ram broke them effortlessly.

He showed him huge trees Bali uprooted.  
Ram shattered them like dry branches.

Sugreev finally believed.

---

## The End of Bali

Ram told Sugreev:

> "Go challenge Bali.  
I will help from the shadows."

Sugreev hesitated.  
But he trusted Ram now.

He went.  
Bali attacked brutally.  
Sugreev ran back, confused why Ram didn’t shoot.

Ram said:

> "You both look alike.  
I could not tell who was who."

He placed a garland on Sugreev’s neck  
and sent him again.

This time, Ram shot Bali from behind  
an arrow straight into his chest.

People debate why.  
But Ram’s explanation was simple:

> "You took your brother’s wife.  
That is a sin beyond forgiveness.  
This arrow is not mine.  
It is your ego."

Bali understood.  
He smiled and gave Ram his final request:

> "Take care of my son Angad.  
Make him yours."

And with that, Bali left the world.

His kingdom wept.  
Sugreev performed the last rites.  
And Ram, even in death, gave knowledge  
lessons from the Gita, exactly like Krishna would give later in Dwapar Yuga.

### ✨ Reflection

> Tulsidas wrote about friendship that can move mountains.  
> At 24, I see it as friendship that heals wounds we don’t talk about.
