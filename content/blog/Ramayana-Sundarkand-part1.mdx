Not because it is easy, but because it shows what happens  
when faith finally works.*

## The Moment of Decision

After listening to **Jambvant**, something changed inside Hanuman.

CONFIDENCE.

He smiled and said calmly:

> Wait here.  
> Keep some food for me.  
> I will see Sita… and I will return.

There was no arrogance in his voice.  
Only certainty.

## The Leap That Shook the Earth

In a joyful mood, Hanuman climbed a mountain.  
He gathered his strength.

And jumped.

The leap was so powerful that the mountain sank into the ground by a few inches.

This was no ordinary vanara.

Hanuman was the largest, strongest and most capable among them all.

---

## Trials Over the Ocean

Mid-air, Hanuman rested briefly on a massive rock rising from the ocean  
just enough to breathe and then leapt again.

Soon, he encountered a giant serpent emerging from the sea.

Hanuman spoke gently:

> Let me complete Ram’s work.  
> On my return, you may eat me.

The serpent refused.

It opened its mouth wider and wider.  
Hanuman expanded his body again and again.

At the moment the serpent reached its limit,  
Hanuman suddenly shrank himself, entered its mouth, pierced through  
and escaped.

Intelligence over brute force.

Later, a massive fish leapt from the ocean to devour anything flying above.

Hanuman used neither anger nor fear  
only awareness.

Won again.

And moved on.

### ✨ Reflection

> Strength without intelligence is noise.  
> Intelligence guided by devotion becomes unstoppable.

## First Sight of Lanka

At last, Hanuman reached the forest near **Lanka**.

The trees were dense  
but when he stood tall, he could see beyond them.

A mountain.

Hanuman climbed it swiftly.

From there, he saw Whole **Lanka**.

---

## The Golden City

Lanka was surrounded by the ocean.  
Gold everywhere.

Golden gates.  
Magnificent houses.  
Gardens filled with flowers.  

Elephants, horses, guards, warriors.  
Devils practicing warfare.  
People eating, celebrating, fighting, living.

It was powerful.  
Rich.  
Alive.

And dangerous.

Hanuman understood  
entering openly would be foolish.

---

## Entry in Disguise

Night fell.

Hanuman changed his form into that of a weak, hunched sage 
a sadhu muni who looked harmless.

At the main gate stood a fierce demoness guarding Lanka.

She stopped him:

> Who are you?  
> Do you not know who I am?

Hanuman did not argue.

He struck her with soft hand.

Blood from her mouth.  
She fell.

Rising again, she said:

> If even a monkey can defeat me,  
> I know my time has come.

She stepped aside.

She opened The gates of Lanka.

## Inside the Enemy’s World

Hanuman moved silently through the city,  
searching every corner.

He entered Ravana’s palace  
but Sita was not there.

Then he sensed something unexpected.

A divine energy.

A temple.

How could such purity exist in Lanka?

---

## Meeting Vibhishan

Inside, **Vibhishan** was awake  
chanting words that reminded Hanuman of Ram’s teachings,  
similar to the wisdom Ram spoke at Bali’s death.

Hanuman approached him as a sage.

They spoke.

Hanuman said:

> You are like my Ram.  
> Do you know him?

Then Hanuman told Vibhishan everything  
about Ram, Sita, exile and devotion.

Vibhishan was overwhelmed.

He confessed:

> I do not belong here.  
> I live in Lanka, but my soul does not.  
> I want to serve Ram.

Hanuman smiled and replied:

> Ram helped a monkey like me  
> as if I were his brother.  
> He will surely accept you.

---

## The Path to Sita

Hanuman revealed his purpose:

> I am here for Ram’s work.  
> I need to see Sita.

Vibhishan nodded.

And pointed the way.

> She is in **Ashoka Vatika**.

---

Only one thing remained.

To find Sita.

And to remind her 
that Ram was coming.

Thank you for reading.  

In the next part, Hanuman will meet Sita.
