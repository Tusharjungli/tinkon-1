The first time I truly felt lost in life was during my 11th-grade mathematics class. My brain had always been programmed to study physics, chemistry, and maths, with everything else marked as temporary or trivial. But adolescence hit differently—I found myself constantly distracted, endlessly curious about anything but what was being taught. One day, I completely zoned out, spending almost the entire lecture thinking about a car I had seen earlier that morning. My mind wandered from the car’s engine to the life of its owner, and it wasn't until the class was nearly over that I realized how deeply lost I had been in thought.

This was my first real experience of losing myself in my mind, and it felt significant. I started questioning the relevance of the structured education I was receiving. How would mathematics ever connect to my real interests? I learned to embrace these moments of deep contemplation, realizing there was always some deeper reason or connection behind the things that happened around me. Sometimes, the deepest reflections led me to understand complex emotions, like reminiscing about my grandmother’s daily rituals after her passing, and understanding the significance behind seemingly mundane routines.

There was a turning point during my second year of college when, instead of studying textbooks, I found myself diving into self-help books. Sitting quietly, I would close my eyes, contemplating deeply about what I had read, connecting these insights directly to my life. One powerful realization emerged clearly: my degree wouldn't guarantee success or happiness. It triggered an important decision—I decided to pursue self-learning, relying less on traditional education systems.

Feeling lost has consistently revealed important truths about myself. When life's pace becomes overwhelming and situations turn messy, I've learned to intentionally slow down. In these moments, I stare blankly at the wall—seemingly paralyzed to an outside observer—and break down complicated issues into smaller, manageable pieces. It's a mental exercise, quietly and deeply writing these ideas in my brain, and patiently letting them sink in. Although it might look peculiar, this practice helps me understand and overcome life's complexities.

A clear example of this occurred recently when I was undecided about meeting a friend. By deeply visualizing possible outcomes, my intuition eventually guided me toward making the visit. Remarkably, even my fear of discomfort due to the hot weather dissipated—on the day of our meeting, an unexpected cool breeze blew, affirming my belief that deep, intentional thoughts can influence reality in small, magical ways.

Despite initially enjoying these profound moments of introspection, societal pressure taught me to feel ashamed of being lost in thought. People around me emphasized the importance of always being present, equating deep contemplation with distraction or laziness. For a long time, I suppressed my natural inclination toward deep thinking, dismissing my genuine thoughts in favor of societal expectations. Only later did I realize this was a mistake—suppressing my true self was never the answer.

A life-changing realization came after reading the book "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind." I learned that deeply-held intentions manifest sooner or later. After college, unsure whether to pursue an MBA, I lost myself in deep thought about this decision. Although I eventually did not get into an MBA program, the profound reflection around this decision deeply impacted my life path. Ironically, failing in the pursuit of this goal taught me more about myself than success ever could.

One misconception I've observed is how society undervalues deep thought. Today's world values speed and immediate results—exams with shorter time limits, videos shrinking into reels. Deep, contemplative thinking has become unusual, even frowned upon. I've felt the pressure when friends around me scroll through their phones while I quietly think. It looks odd to them, but to me, it feels essential and empowering.

Building my blog "Tink On It" was another moment where feeling lost turned into clarity. Struggling to envision the perfect minimal and clean design, I gathered inspirations, let my mind absorb them deeply, and eventually dreamt about the project. Trusting my subconscious, I eventually found clarity, resulting in the website you're visiting today.

If I could give advice to my younger self, I'd say: trust your instincts and thoughts, and don't fear failure. Mistakes are powerful lessons, and your subconscious mind is more capable than you realize. I used to feel foolish and easily swayed by others, blindly trusting those with experience. Now, I've learned the importance of listening primarily to myself, understanding that even knowledgeable people might not always have the right answers for me.

Unexpected joys and "aha" moments have come from being lost in thought. Moments of realization showed me simpler solutions to problems I had agonized over. If someone currently feels deeply lost, my advice is simple: clear your mind first, then spend quiet moments reflecting without stress. Allow your subconscious to guide you, especially right before sleep, and trust that clarity will greet you in the morning.

**Being lost, I now know, isn't a weakness. It might just be your strongest, most underrated superpower.**
