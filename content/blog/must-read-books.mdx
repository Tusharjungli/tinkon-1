Books are still the best teachers in this fast-moving tech world. ChatGPT can summarize a book, for sure—but it can’t deliver the **emotions** the author poured into every sentence. A book holds not just words, but **a life’s worth of pain, growth, and truth**.

I’m not going deep into genres. This is about the **books that found me** when I needed them the most. Books that changed my thinking. Books that saved me.

let's start.

## My Rock Bottom Story

After the COVID lockdown, I was lost. I was spending my days scrolling Instagram, playing games, and masturbating—just wasting time and drowning in my own comfort. Career? Goals? Zero hope. I thought lockdown would last forever, but even after it ended, the bad habits stayed.

One day, I decided to take a trip to the mountains with my cousin. At the bus stand, a man was selling books. I knew nothing about books or authors, but I felt something. I didn’t have much cash, but he gave me a book for ₹100 anyway. That’s how it started. Today, I’ve read over 30 books. And here are the **5 and a bonus book that helped me the most**.

## 1. [Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki](https://amzn.to/4f1kXWy)

This was the **first book I ever bought**. I had no idea what it was about—I just liked the title. I started reading it during my trip, and man, it blew my mind.

I grew up with a middle-class mindset: study hard, get a job, take a loan, and live on EMI. That’s what my family taught me. But this book? It told me that was a trap.

**Key lesson:** Poor people work for money. Rich people make money work for them.

This book helped me realize the difference between **assets and liabilities**. It’s not a how-to guide. It’s a **mindset shift**. It changed how I think about money, work, and freedom. If you're in your 20s, read this now.

## 2. [The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Dr. Joseph Murphy](https://amzn.to/44XM0xo)

I read this when I was constantly failing in life. I wanted change but couldn’t break free. This book taught me the true power of my mind.

I used to think “manifestation” was just Instagram fluff. But after this book, I started writing affirmations. I started visualizing. And slowly... things shifted. I became more focused. More clear.

**Key lesson:** You don’t become what you want—you become what you believe.

Your thoughts are seeds. If you believe you’re unlucky or unworthy, your subconscious will prove it true. But if you repeat new thoughts, vividly and consistently, your mind will start working for you—not against you.

## 3. [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](https://amzn.to/40vWQt0)

This biography hit me differently. I was jobless and frustrated, thinking I wasn’t good enough. Then I read about Steve—his failures, his arrogance, his obsession. And I saw a man who *bent reality*.

**Key lesson:** Reality is negotiable.

Jobs wasn’t perfect. He was harsh, rude, and even toxic. But he believed in something bigger. He pushed boundaries. He controlled **everything**—hardware, software, packaging—because he wanted the product to be *art*.

It reminded me to take pride in what I do. To go deep, to care, to obsess. Because that’s where greatness lies.

## 4. [Shoe Dog by Phil Knight](https://amzn.to/4eWHpQs)

I picked this up after reading Steve Jobs and wanted another brand story. Nike was perfect.

Phil Knight was just a confused 24-year-old, like me. But he had this “crazy idea” to sell Japanese shoes. He bluffed his way into a deal and built Nike from scratch.

**Key lesson:** Success isn’t neat. It’s built on late nights, failure, and refusing to quit.

This book helped me fall in love with **the hustle**. With risking it all. It showed me how failure isn’t just okay—it’s essential.

Also, the story behind the Nike swoosh logo is hilarious. Read it just for that.

## 5. [Bhagavad Gita](https://amzn.to/3GBikhv)

This book is my soul anchor. I’ve read it **five times**, and every time it feels new. Every time I’m lost or broken, I return to it.

It’s not a religious book—it’s a **manual for life**.

**Key lesson:** Do your work. Detach from the outcome.

Krishna tells Arjuna to fight—not because it’s easy, but because it’s right. And that’s the ultimate courage: doing what needs to be done, even when you’re scared.

This book helped me detach from validation, fear, ego, and pain. I still struggle, but this book gives me strength to get up and act.

## 6. [Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke](https://amzn.to/4m6LR1v)

This one is personal. I was deep in addiction—porn, social media, even overthinking. I felt numb. This book explained **why**.

We live in a world where **pleasure is everywhere**—scrolls, sugar, reels, porn. But the more dopamine we chase, the more our brain crashes into pain. And that’s the loop.

**Key lesson:** Real joy comes from discipline. Not from more pleasure, but from *less*.

This book helped me understand my brain. It helped me take control. I started cold showers. Dopamine fasts. Small, real things. Slowly, I felt alive again.
