I got interested in this topic right after I completed college, while waiting for my results to come out. At that time, I was lazy, anxious, brain-rotted, and felt almost like a failure. But then I started working hard.  

My first book was *Rich Dad Poor Dad*. That opened the door to more books. The second one I picked—just because the name sounded cool—was *The Power of the Subconscious Mind*. That’s when I first realized I was only using my brain for survival, not for its full potential.  

The brain is far more powerful than we think.  

People say the human brain is the most powerful thing on Earth, capable of controlling other things. That’s not fake—it’s real. I first read about it in 2022. By 2025, I started experiencing it myself.  

This blog is about my learning and experience with the subconscious brain.

## What Is the Subconscious Brain?

From the name, you can guess there are two parts of the brain: **conscious** and **subconscious**.  

- The **conscious brain** is the one you control.  
- The **subconscious brain** is always active, but you barely notice or control it.  

Think of it as an invisible agent—recording everything, shaping itself based on your actions, and influencing you without your awareness.  

In short: the subconscious brain works all the time (even during sleep), isn’t under your direct control, and is way more powerful than the conscious brain.

## Basics of the Subconscious Brain  

A healthy adult takes about **22,000 breaths per day**. But you don’t think about every breath—it happens automatically. That’s the subconscious brain at work.  

Other automatic functions include:  
- Dreams  
- Natural waking alarm  
- Fight or flight response  
- Heartbeat  

These are just a few of its functions. Believe me, this is only scratching the surface.

## Subconscious in Sleep and Dreams  

The subconscious is most active during deep sleep—when you’re most unaware of yourself and your body.  

Have you ever dreamed of controlling something far away without touching it? That’s your subconscious giving you hints of its power.  

Think of it like a **plant**:  
- The conscious brain plants the seed.  
- Your daily actions are the sunlight and water.  
- The subconscious grows it silently, especially at night.  

But just like some plants fail, the subconscious also depends on how well you nurture it.

## How Subconscious Shapes You  

Since birth, your subconscious has been recording everything—habits, fears, patterns. That’s why everyone is different.  

Take handwriting: we all learn the same way, but no two handwritings are identical. That’s the subconscious imprinting repetition differently in each person.  

Habits and small differences like these make you unique.

## The Hard Part: Changing the Subconscious  

Once something gets into the subconscious, removing it is very hard. Not impossible, but difficult—because you can’t directly control it.

## A Simple Trick to See Your Subconscious  

Try this:  
- Sit on a chair.  
- No phone, no distractions.  
- Close your eyes.  

After a few minutes, your mind will start wandering. Don’t force it. Just observe. That’s your subconscious at work—thinking randomly, without your control.

## How Subconscious Creates Reality  

Have you ever wanted something badly and then got it? Or felt like you’d lose a match even when it was 50-50—and you did lose?  

That’s the subconscious.  

The subconscious doesn’t understand truth or lies. It simply acts. Repeated thoughts become seeds, and it works on them to make them real—positive or negative.  

Dreams are proof. They blend conscious reality with subconscious imagination, creating experiences that feel impossible but real.  

Deep sleep is when the subconscious works the hardest: repairing, healing, filtering, and syncing your brain. That’s why naps refresh ideas and why wounds heal faster during rest.

## Planting Seeds in the Subconscious  

Here’s a small experiment:  

Suppose you want chocolate but don’t have money.  
- Keep repeating: “I want chocolate.”  
- Meditate, imagine the chocolate, lose yourself in the thought.  
- Let it sink like a seed.  

Keep “watering” it—remind yourself now and then. Sooner or later, you’ll attract chocolate in some form.  

I tried this myself. In 2023, I planted the thought of getting a golden retriever. By 2025, I had one.

## The Science Behind It  

I’m not a scientist, but here’s what I’ve learned:  

When you plant a thought in your subconscious, it keeps running quietly in the background. Without realizing, you take actions that move you closer to it.  

It’s not magic—it’s the brain wiring you toward opportunities.

## Shortcuts and Drugs  

Yes, there are chemical shortcuts like LSD and marijuana. These blur the line between conscious and subconscious temporarily. But people misuse them, so this isn’t the right way.

## Final Thoughts  

I put a lot of effort into writing this blog. Honestly, even while writing, I felt like my subconscious brain was helping me.  

If you’ve experienced your subconscious in action, I’d love to hear your story too.
