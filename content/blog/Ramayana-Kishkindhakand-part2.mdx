## The Rise of a King

After Bali’s fall, Ram asked Lakshman to prepare **Sugreev** for kingship.  
The rituals were performed and **Angad** (Bali’s son) was appointed as the crown prince.

The people of Kishkindha accepted Sugreev with relief and hope.  
A wounded kingdom found stability.

Before leaving, Ram taught Sugreev the duties of a king.  
Rule with humility.  
Protect your people.  
And never forget your promises.

---

## The Mountain

As the rainy season approached, Ram chose to stay on **Parvarshan Mountain**.  
A peaceful cave became his next home.

Spring bloomed first.  
Flowers grew, trees breathing.  

Then came the monsoon.

Tulsidas describes days where the sky never cleared.  
Clouds covered the world.  
Rain endlessly.  
Time moved slowly.

And through all these seasons  
there was still **no news of Sita**.

## When Patience Turns to Fire

Autumn passed.  
Winter approached.

One day, Ram spoke to Lakshman:

> Sugreev has his kingdom, his comfort, his joy.  
> He has forgotten the promise he made to me.

For the first time, Ram’s anger surfaced.  
He said he felt capable of destroying Sugreev,  
just as he had destroyed Bali.

Lakshman did not hesitate.  
He grabbed his bow, ready to act.

But Ram stopped him.

> Do not kill him.  
> Show him my anger.  
> Bring him to me.

## Kishkindha Trembles

Lakshman entered Kishkindha like a storm.  
Weapons struck the ground.  
Trees shook.  
Fear spread among the monkeys.

Seeing this, **Angad** stepped forward and pleaded for calm.  
Sugreev heard everything.

At the same time, **Hanuman**, who never forgot his duty, reminded Sugreev:

> You promised Ram.  
> And Ram never forgets.

Sugreev realized his mistake.

He immediately ordered Hanuman to summon every monkey warrior from all directions  
within **fifteen days**.

> Anyone who fails to come  
will face death.

---

## A King Faces His Duty

Sugreev sent **Tara**(Bali’s wife) along with elders to calm Lakshman.  
After Lakshman’s anger settled, he delivered Ram’s command:

> Come with me.  
> Ram is calling you.

Sugreev followed.

When Sugreev reached Ram, he fell at his feet and explained  
the burdens of kingship and his delay.

Ram listened quietly.

And then said,

> What has happened is past.  
> Now fulfill your promise.  
> Find Sita.

---

## The Call 

Sugreev gave a single order.

Within minutes, **hundreds of thousands of monkeys** gathered  
of different sizes, colors and strengths.

Young and old.  
Warriors and leaders.

All stood before Ram and Lakshman.

Sugreev declared:

> This is Ram’s command.  
> I am Ram’s servant.  
> Find Sita within one month.  
> Fail and death will follow.

The army scattered in all directions.

---

## The Ones Who Went South

Sugreev then called his strongest warriors:

**Angad.  
Nal.  
Neel.  
Hanuman.**

He sent them **south**, where danger was greatest.

> Search with devotion.  
> And when you feel lost,  
> remember Ram’s name.

At the end stood Hanuman.

Tallest.  
Strongest.  
Calmest.

Ram called him close and placed **his ring** in Hanuman’s hand.

> Give this to Sita  
> when you find her.

Hanuman pressed the ring to his heart  
and moved forward  
with unshakable determination.

---

### ✨ Reflection
 
> Hanuman did not need reminders.  
> He only needed a purpose.

---

This part is not about war.  
It is about **delay**, **responsibility** and **remembrance**.


And that difference  
changed the course of the Ramayana.

In the next part,  
the journey moves beyond land, beyond fear  
towards the impossible.
