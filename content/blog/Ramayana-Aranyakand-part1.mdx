For me, it felt like life pushing you from peace into the real tests meant to shape you.*

## The Crow and the First Wound

One peaceful morning in Chitrakoot,  
Ram sat quietly making a **flower garland for Sita**.  
The forest air was calm and everything felt like normal.

Suddenly, a **wild crow** attacked Sita and **wounded her feet**.  
Blood dripped from her toe.

Without thinking much, Ram took his bow,  
shot an arrow,  
and the crow fell wounded and basically surviving with **only one eye** left.

People watching this miracle trembled.  
Ram realized that **fame was spreading**,  
and if more crowds gathered, peace would die.

So quietly, without celebrations or farewell,  
Ram, Sita, and Lakshman **left Chitrakoot**.

> Sometimes God removes us from comfort  
> not because we are weak,  
> but because growth needs living alone and hidden.

## The Ashram of Atri Muni

The trio reached the **ashram of Atri Muni and Mata Anusuya**.  
Atri welcomed them with sacred water,  
and Mata Anusuya embraced Sita with love.

She gifted Sita **divine ornaments** and **teachings**  
that would later become her strength.

After blessings, Ram respectfully asked permission to leave.

They walked ahead into deeper forests...

Ram leading, Sita following and Lakshman protecting from behind.

## The Killing of Viradh

Clouds covered the sky.  
Inside the dark forest, a creature named **Viradh** attacked.  
Ram defeated and killed him and as usual protecting Sita.

Then they visited **Sharbhajangi Muni**,  
who was in his final moments.  
His last wish was fulfilled to see Ram.

He bowed towards Ram  
and **left his body** peacefully.

---

## Skeletons in the Forest

Further ahead, Ram saw **bones and skeletons** scattered everywhere.  
Whole forest was so silent.

Ram asked a sage what had happened.

> Devils killed the saints who lived here.  
> No one is left to protect us.

Hearing this, Ram speak loudly:

> I promise I will destroy every devil  
> troubling holy people on this earth.

From that moment  
**the forest shook with war**.  
Ram hunted demons one by one.

---

## Meeting the Old Servant

In a nearby hermitage,  
Ram met **an old sevak from Agastya Muni’s ashram**  
who danced with joy upon seeing Ram after so long.

He took them to the ashram and offered prayers.

Ram said,  
> Now we must move ahead to Agastya Muni.

The sevak guided them.

---

## The Blessing of Agastya Muni

Agastya Muni welcomed them with deep respect.  
All saints gathered around Ram.

Ram said:

> I promised to end the devils who torture the saints.  
> Give me the strength and mantra to do it.

Agastya replied:

> You both brothers are powerful,  
> but demons hold dark powers.  
> For winning this war, go to **Panchvati in Dandak Forest**  
> and make your home there.

And once again story shifted direction.

## The Arrival of Jatayu

On their way to Panchvati,  
they met **Jatayu**, the king of eagles  
who promised protection and friendship.

Near the **Godavari river**,  
they built their home and began life in the deep forest.

For the first time since exile,  
the saints of Dandak forest slept safely.

### ✨ Reflection

> Tulsidas says this was where Ram became the protector of the world.  
> For me, it is the moment life changes from peace to purpose  
> when destiny no longer lets you hide from who you’re meant to become.

The journey ahead is darker, heavier and unforgettable.  
Because **the real storm is about to begin**.

Next part:
**The arrival of Surpanakha and the beginning of war.**
