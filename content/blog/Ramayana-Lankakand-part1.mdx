## The Decision to Begin

Ram listened calmly to the sages.

Then he said simply:

> Why think more?  
Begin now.

There was no hesitation in his voice.  
No doubt.  
Only clarity.

Jambavan stepped forward and smiled:

> You are building a bridge with such an army.  
Let this Setu be known as **Ram Setu**.

Hanuman agreed.

The name itself felt like a vow.

---

## Nal and Neel Take Charge

Jambavan called **Nal and Neel**  
masters of structure and strength.

They were given the responsibility to begin the work immediately.

The order was simple:

> Everyone brings what they can.

Trees.  
Rocks.  
Wood.  
Whatever strength allowed.

Hanuman carried massive stones.  
Jambavan lifted entire trees.  
Vanaras ran and grabbed whatever they can.  

Nal and Neel guided everything  
layer by layer  
with intelligence.

Ram watched silently.

He told Lakshman:

> When this Setu is complete,  
we will pray to it.

### ✨ Reflection

> Faith doesn’t always wait for miracles..

## The Ocean Watches

Creatures of the ocean circled the Setu.  
They struck it, examined it.  
This was new to them.

People often say rocks floated by magic.  
But Tulsidas shows something deeper.

It wasn’t just rocks.

It was trees.  
Ropes.  
Intelligence.  
Unity.

That is how the Setu stood.

By evening, it was complete.

---

## Crossing the Impossible

Ram stood at the front.  
The army followed.

But the Setu grew crowded.  
Thousands moved together.

Ram ordered Nal and Neel to divide the army into groups  
so the bridge could hold.

Slowly, carefully  
everyone crossed.

By sunset  
the entire army stood on the other shore.

Ram ordered rest.

Everyone was happy.

Vanaras ran into forests, ate fruits, rested, laughed.  
Relief filled the air.

The impossible was now behind them.

---

## Fear Enters Lanka

News reached Lanka quickly.

> Ram has crossed the ocean.

For a moment, Ravana felt fear.

Then he laughed.

He went to Mandodari for rest.

But Mandodari was not calm.

She held Ravana’s hand and said:

> A messenger burned Lanka.  
And now Ram crossed the ocean with ease.  
He is not an ordinary man.

She pleaded:

> Return Sita.  
Stop this war.

She spoke with wisdom.

## Ravana’s Blind Confidence

Ravana flexed his arms.

> I have won wars before.  
I will crush Ram.

Mandodari knew then  
war was certain.

In court, Ravana asked for advice.

Some laughed:

> Monkeys and bears?  
That is food for us.

But one of his sons spoke carefully:

> One monkey burned Lanka.  
An army of them built a bridge across the ocean.  
Think with reason, not with pride.

He suggested peace.  
He suggested returning Sita.

Ravana exploded.

> Who taught you to think?  
Go and hide if you fear war.

The son left court.

## The Calm Before Fire

That evening  
Ravana drank, danced, laughed.

He flexed his strength.

But outside his palace  
the ocean had already been crossed.

---


Ram did not rush into battle.  
He built a path first.

Ravana did not listen to warnings.  
He laughed instead.

This is how wars truly begin.
