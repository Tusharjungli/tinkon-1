## 📚 The First Time I Felt Lost

It started in an 11th-grade math class.

I was supposed to be solving formulas, but my brain was somewhere else—thinking about a car I saw that morning, the person driving it, and random questions about life.  
By the end of class, I had zero math done… but for some reason, I felt more awake than ever.

That moment of wandering? It planted something big inside me.

## 🧠 Wandering ≠ Wasting Time

Soon I noticed a pattern.

Whenever I “zoned out,” I’d stumble into insights:  
Why does school feel disconnected from real life?  
Why do I remember my grandma’s tea habits more than half my syllabus?

These weren’t just distractions. They were signs that something inside me wanted to **wake up**.

In college, I started skipping the usual syllabus and turned to self-help, philosophy, and silence. One night I realized: **no degree will guarantee happiness**.

That realization didn’t depress me. It freed me.

## 🤯 When “Lost” Is Just Deep Thinking

Whenever I felt stuck or overwhelmed, I’d sit alone.

It looked like I was doing nothing—but inside, I was sorting, questioning, and building new ways to understand my life. Those “nothing” moments helped me survive the chaos.

## 🌦️ One Small Decision Changed Everything

Once, I debated whether to meet a friend. My mind filled with anxiety, “what-ifs,” and overthinking. I finally trusted my gut and went. The weather turned unexpectedly beautiful. We talked for hours.

That day reminded me: sometimes your intuition knows the way—even if you feel lost.

## 🧱 When Society Says “Don’t Drift”

We’re taught to avoid being lost.

“Don’t overthink.”  
“Be present.”  
“Stick to the plan.”

So I tried to silence my thoughts. But instead of feeling found, I felt fake.

Only later did I understand: **I’m a thinker. A wanderer. A slow bloomer.**  
And that’s not broken. That’s human.

## 📖 The Book That Shifted Everything

Reading *The Power of Your Subconscious Mind* cracked something open in me. It showed how our quietest desires shape our reality.

When I failed to get into an MBA program, I felt crushed—but weirdly at peace. Because my lost moments had already started shaping something better.

I wasn’t failing—I was rerouting.

## ⚡ Slow Thinking in a Fast World

We live in speed-mode.  
Short-form content, pressure to decide fast, fear of missing out.

But some of your deepest answers?  
They come slowly—through daydreams, reflections, even “doing nothing.”

My blog, *Tink On It*, exists because of these slow moments.  
The name itself was born in a mental fog, not a brainstorm.  
The color scheme came to me during a walk.

**Being lost gave birth to something real.**

## 💬 If You’re Feeling Lost Right Now…

Here’s my advice:

- Don’t force clarity.  
- Don’t chase what everyone else is chasing.  
- Sit with it. Wander.  
- And most of all—**trust your inner compass**.

You’re not lazy. You’re just in a deeper season of becoming.

The answers you need may not come through a plan or a checklist.  
They might show up in silence, in dreams, in strange connections—right before sleep, or during a quiet walk.
