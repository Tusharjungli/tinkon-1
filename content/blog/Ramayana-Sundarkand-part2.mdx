## Ashoka Vatika 

Hanuman reached Lanka still disguised  
as a bent, quiet sadhu.

unnoticed.

From behind the trees, he finally saw **Sita**.

She had lost weight.  
Her long hair almost touched the ground.  
She sat in the same place day and night,  
eyes lowered, mind anchored only to Ram.

She didn’t cry loudly.  
She didn’t scream.

She waited.

Hanuman wanted to rush to her,  
but security surrounded Ashoka Vatika.  
This was not a place for strength  
it was a place for patience.

## Ravana and the Ten Faces

Ravana arrived with queens and guards.  
He spoke sweetly but dangerously.

He promised power.  
He promised a crown.  
He promised that every queen would serve her.

But Sita never looked at him.

She said calmly,

> You are a multi-faced devil.  
> I am waiting for Ram 
> the one who will end you.

Ravana’s patience cracked.  
His sword came out.

> I will kill you.

Sita replied without fear:

> Only Ram or destiny can touch me.  
> If death comes, so be it.  
> I will reach Ram 
> one way or another.

For the first time, Ravana stepped back.

### ✨ Reflection

> Ravana didn’t have ten physical faces.  
> He had ten desires.  
> And Sita defeated all ten  
> without lifting a weapon.

## The Night of Mental Warfare

Ravana gathered demon women.  
Not for violence  
but for manipulation.

Magic. Fear. Lies.

They tried to break Sita’s mind.

Only **Trijata** showed a trace of humanity.  
She spoke gently, but even she couldn’t save Sita from despair.

At one point, Sita whispered:

> Please… kill me.  
> End this pain.

That night, she looked at the sky  
and prayed not for release from this earth.

## The Ring That Changed Everything

Hanuman could no longer remain silent.

He dropped **Ram’s ring**.

Sita picked it up.

She examined it again and again.  

A ray of hope..

> No one can copy Ram’s ring.

Then Hanuman spoke in low volume. 
telling the story of Ram.

Listening, Sita’s heart broke open.

She said:

> If you are real, come before me.

Hanuman stepped closer.  
Still, she turned her face away  
a one-man woman, even in despair.

> I am Ram’s bhakt,  
> and Ram sent me.

Sita questioned him.  
Hanuman answered everything  
only Ram’s devotee could know.

Her eyes filled.

> Does Ram think of me?  
> Does he still love me?

Hanuman replied:

> Without you, everything is tasteless for him.  
> His heart never left you.

## Restored Faith

Sita worried:

> How can monkeys fight demons?  
> You all look so small…

Hanuman smiled.

He shed the disguise.

Before her stood a being vast and radiant 
broad shoulders, shining strength, divine presence.

For a moment, Sita saw victory.

Then Hanuman returned to his sadhu form.

> With Ram, nothing is small.

Sita placed her hand on his head.

She blessed him.

> You will never grow weak.  
> Ram will always protect you.

Those words pierced Hanuman’s soul.

## Permission to Destruction

Before leaving, Hanuman asked gently:

> Mata, may I eat fruits from this garden?  
> I am hungry after a long journey.

Sita hesitated.

> Demons guard it.

Hanuman smiled:

> I fear no one 
> except you.

She gave permission.

And with that permission,  
**Sundar Kand turned toward fire.**

### ✨ Reflection

> For Tulsidas, this was devotion meeting destiny.  
> For me, it was proof that  
> even one reminder of love  
> can keep someone alive  
> in the darkest prison.

---

Hanuman did not rescue Sita that night.  
He restored her **hope**.

Because he promised Jambvant.

And sometimes,  
hope is stronger than escape.
