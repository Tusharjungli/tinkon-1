When Google first appeared, teachers and parents thought it was a shortcut—maybe even a cheat code. “You’ll never learn anything if you can just search for answers!”  
Sound familiar? Because today, AI tools are wearing the same villain costume.

But here’s the truth: **AI isn’t here to replace your thinking. It’s here to amplify it.**  
Just like Google did.  
Just like calculators did.  
Just like every new tool humanity has ever built.

AI won’t do your homework *for* you. But it can spark ideas, help you work smarter, and push your creative limits—if you let it.

**Coming soon:**
