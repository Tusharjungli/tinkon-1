This night, words did more damage than weapons.*

## The First Night on Enemy Land

Ram’s army finally stepped onto Lanka’s soil.  
Monkeys and bears scattered for food, rest and shade.  

Ram and Lakshman chose a clean place for the night.  
Ram rested his head on **Sugreev’s lap**,  
while **Vibhishan** quietly discussed entry paths and weaknesses.

Ram looked east.  
The moon was rising slowly, bright and peaceful.

He asked everyone around him:

> *What do you think about the moon tonight?*

Everyone shared their thoughts.  
But Hanuman smiled and said:

> The moon is your servant, Prabhu.  
That’s why it shines so bright today.

Ram laughed softly.

Then he looked south.

## Ravana’s Bar in the Sky

Dark clouds.  
Lightning flashes.  
Ram said calmly:

> Vibhishan, rain is coming.

Vibhishan smiled.

> That’s not rain.  
That is Ravana’s bar at the highest point of Lanka.

Ravana had built a palace so bright,  
it looked like a cloud filled with lightning.

And then something strange happened.

Without wind.  
Without touch.  
**Ravana’s crown fell** from the top of that palace.

Shock spread through the bar.

Ravana laughed loudly:

> A fallen crown is a good sign.  
Go sleep. Nothing bad will happen.

But **Mandodri** was not convinced.

She pulled Ravana aside.

> Please stop this war.  
Return Sita. Choose peace. just once, for me.

Ravana laughed harder.

> I am in my land.  
Ram is in my trap.  
I control destiny itself.

Mandodri understood.  
War was inevitable.

## A Messenger Is Chosen

At dawn, Ram gathered everyone.

Jambavan spoke:

> Send Angad as the messenger.

Everyone agreed.

Ram told Angad:

> I won’t give you words.  
Use your brain. Speak what is right.

Angad smiled, stretched his body,  
and walked alone into Lanka.

---

## Angad Enters Lanka

On the way, Angad met one of Ravana’s sons playing.

Play turned into fight.  
Fight turned into death.

The news spread like fire:

> The monkey is back.  
Hanuman has returned.
Fear cleared Angad’s path.

When he entered Ravana’s court,  
people mistook him for Hanuman and stood up in respect.

Ravana noticed.  
Ravana burned.

---

## The Clash of Words

Ravana asked:

> Who are you?

Angad replied:

> I am Angad. Son of Bali.  
Sent by my godfather, Shri Ram.

He continued calmly:

> Leave Sita.  
Walk behind her.  
Meet Ram with humility.  
This war will end today.

Ravana mocked him.

They spoke of strength.  
Of fathers.  
Of past wars.

Ravana tried to poison Angad’s mind  
with words, basically his **ten faces**, his mental weapons.

But Angad stood firm.

---

## The Kingdom Shakes

Angad struck the floor in anger.

The entire kingdom shook.

Crowns fell.

Angad grabbed a few and threw them out of Lanka.

They landed near Ram’s camp.

Monkeys panicked.

Ram laughed.

> Don’t fear.  
These are Ravana’s crowns — thrown as signs.

Hanuman leaped down, collected them and handed them to Ram.

Lanka knew now.

The enemy was close.

---

## The Final Challenge

Angad warned Ravana:

> If I don’t pull out your tongue,  
I am not Bali’s son.

Then he placed his foot on the ground.

> Move my foot.  
If you can, I’ll return with Ram.

Servants tried.  
Sons tried.  
No one could move it.

Ravana himself tried.

Angad said:

> Don’t touch my foot.  
Touch Ram’s feet only then you’ll be spared.

Ravana turned away.

Defeated in silence.

---

## Return Without Victory

Angad roared and left.

Mandodri pleaded again with Ravana that night.

> Your sons are dead.  
Your people are afraid.  
Still you refuse to see truth.

Ravana walked away.

---

## Return of Angad

Angad returned.

Ram asked gently:

> Did you throw those crowns?

Angad nodded.

> They represent Ravana’s powers.  
Now they lie with you.

Ram smiled.

Then Angad told everything.

The war was no longer avoidable.

### ✨ Reflection

> Ravana didn’t lose this war on the battlefield.  
> He lost it when he chose ego over listening.

---

Now only one thing remained.

War.
