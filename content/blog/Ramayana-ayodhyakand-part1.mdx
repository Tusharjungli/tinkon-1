## The Mirror and the Thought

One morning, King Dashrath looked into the mirror 
and noticed strands of white hair.  

A realization struck him:  
> I must see Ram crowned while I still breathe.  

a father’s wish to witness his son’s glory before his own end.  

The preparations for the coronation began.  
Ayodhya shone like gold, music echoed in every corner —  
but amidst the joy, **Ram was quiet.**

He missed Bharat, who was away at his maternal home.  
And deeper still, he didn’t want a throne that separated him from his brothers.  
> We are one,” he thought. “If I rule alone, I lose them.

## The Whisper of Manthra

Then came **Manthra**, the maid of Queen Kaikeyi — clever, bitter, and venom-tongued.  
Seeing the celebration, jealousy sparked in her heart.  

She ran to Kaikeyi:  
> How can you smile when Ram becomes king and Bharat stays forgotten?  
Do you not see Kaushalya’s cunning plan?

Kaikeyi laughed at first, dismissing her words.  
But Manthra’s persistence slowly twisted her thoughts.  
With each sentence, she burned the lamp of fire.  

Soon, Kaikeyi was consumed by suspicion.  
She asked, trembling,  
> What must I do? 

And Manthra struck her final arrow:  
> Remember the two boons King Dashrath promised you.  
Ask for Bharat’s coronation,  
and Ram’s exile for fourteen years.

### ✨ Reflection

> Sometimes, it’s not the demon outside that ruins peace —  
> it’s the whisper inside that poisons the heart.

## The Two Promises

Kaikeyi dressed herself in sorrow —  
barefoot, her jewels gone and her eyes red.  

When Dashrath entered her chamber, he saw her lying on the floor.  
Concerned, he knelt beside her:  
> What pains you, my queen? Just tell me the name of enemy. 

She reminded him of the two promises he once made in battle.  
The king smiled warmly  
> Ask not two, but four. Whatever you desire. 

And she spoke the words that froze everything: 
> I only want two.

> Let Bharat be king.  
> Send Ram to the forest for fourteen years. 

Dashrath’s hands trembled. His crown felt heavy.  
He closed his eyes —  
the world dimmed around him.  

He whispered:  
> Raghukul ki reet sada chali aayi...  
> Pran jaaye par vachan na jaye.”

## The Fall of the King

Dashrath collapsed to the floor.  
Kaikeyi’s words cut him deeper than any sword.  

He begged her to reconsider,  
but she had already fallen under Manthra’s spell.  

Finally, broken and breathless, the king said,  
>  what you must, Kaikeyi.  
But remember — this will haunt you forever and after this never stand in front of me.  

That night, Ayodhya slept unaware —  
tomorrow’s dawn would change destiny.

## Ram Learns the Truth

When summoned, Ram came running .  
He bowed before Kaikeyi and asked gently,  
> Mother, what troubles my father?

Kaikeyi spoke coldly,  
> You must leave for the forest today.  
Bharat will be crowned in your place. 

Ram listened silently.  
And then, with a peaceful smile, said,  
> If that pleases my father and keeps his word,  
I accept it with joy and nothing to worry about. 

He bowed once again with grace.

---

### ✨ Reflection

> Greatness is not in how you rise —  
> it’s in how calmly you bow to destiny.

## The Mothers and the Tears

Ram went to Queen Kaushalya and told her everything.  
She stood frozen, torn between love and dharma.  

> If I stop you,” she said softly,  
> I go against truth. 
But if I let you go, I'll lose my life.

Sita stood beside her — silent, young, and trembling.  
Her eyes followed Ram like a shadow.  

Ram told her,  
> Stay here, Sita. The forest is harsh. You are gentle. you are not meant to live in forest. stay here and take care of your in laws.  

Sita knelt, touched Kaushalya’s feet, and said,  
> Where Ram goes, Sita goes.  
My life is tied to his.  
Without him, I would not live even a moment.  

Her words carried the purity of fire with devotion.

## Lakshman’s Decision

When Lakshman heard of Ram’s exile,  
he ran to him and fell at his feet:  
> I will not let you go alone. Take me with you. 

Ram tried to stop him  
> Father is old. You must stay to care for Ayodhya. Bharat and Shatugan are not here. 
except you no one is here to take care of father.  

But Lakshman refused to rise.  
Finally, seeing his devotion, Ram agreed.

That's how Ram, Sita and Lakshman got ready for vanvas and after getting ready they stand infront of Dashrath for his final permission.
