Have you ever wished you could get advice from the only person who truly gets you—your past self?  
Sometimes, when I feel the most lost, I find clarity by writing a letter to the future me. This is one of those moments.

Dear Future Tushar,
</span>

As I write this, I’m sitting in my overheated room, distractions everywhere, summer sun relentless, and a thousand doubts running through my mind. **Ventilation sucks, and if I’m honest, I’m not sure where life is heading.** Every failure stings. I’m painfully aware I haven’t earned enough yet to really change our parents’ lives.

Dad keeps asking, “What’s next after leaving your MBA?” I wish I had an answer. So, most days, I just avoid the question.

My mind is full of dreams—road trips to the mountains with just my car, my dog, and nature for company. I want to give my parents real comfort, then slip away to a quiet life, soaking up every simple moment.

---

Every failure makes me pause and rethink—how to begin again. *Society loves winners and dramatic failures, but ignores everyone in the middle.* I never wanted to be just another middle-class face in the crowd. I want to be recognized as someone different—even if it’s just by fellow introverts.

But I am proud of some things. Like the day I brought Harry home—no permission, just instinct. He became part of our family in an instant. Watching him play with Mom and Dad was one of the first times I saw them *truly* happy in a long time.

Lately, the best part of my day is a smoothie and a workout.  
These rituals anchor me, even when nothing else makes sense. Skipping them throws off my whole day.

Future Tushar, if you're lost again: read the <b>Bhagavad Gita</b>. Breathe deeply. Sit in nature and let your mind wander, then nap. Trust your instincts—they’re wiser than you think. And don’t care what anyone else says; you’re not here to perform for others.

I’ve made mistakes—especially with smoking. Sometimes out of boredom, sometimes out of stubbornness. Each time I relapse, I notice the triggers, learn a little more, and slowly get better at handling them. Even my failures teach me something.

**Our parents are my greatest blessing.** We’ve seen real poverty and nights full of worry. But they never gave up, and now it’s my turn to give back. My only dream is to make them comfortable and proud—then go live quietly, surrounded by animals and green hills.

<b>When the future feels overwhelming, pause. Breathe. Rest. Remember why you started—this moment of confusion will pass.</b>

Never give up on our shared dream:  
Once you’re secure, build that cabin in the mountains and enjoy the quiet you’ve always wanted.  
*Every tough day now is buying you that freedom.*

You're so close to the life you dreamed of. Just keep going a little longer—don’t quit.

Forgive me for starting late, for copying others instead of trusting myself, and for the friendships I let fade.  
Thank you for being patient. I hope you’re proud of where you are now.

Remember these days—the struggles, the dog cuddles, the cigarettes you learned to quit, the joy and pain. Stay grounded, and never forget how far you’ve come.

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'Caveat, cursive', fontSize: '1.3rem', display: 'block', marginTop: '2em' }}>
Until then, keep moving—I’ll be waiting here for your success story.<br /><br />
Warmest regards,<br />
Your Past Self
