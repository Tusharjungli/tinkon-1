Dear Future Tushar,
</span>


As I write this, I’m physically sitting in my overheated room, struggling to concentrate amidst the distractions of the online world. **Summer is intense, ventilation is poor, and yes—I’m still not entirely sure what direction my life should take.** Emotionally, the failures sting every time they cross my mind, and I'm painfully aware that I'm not earning enough yet to significantly change my parents’ lives. Each day, their hopeful faces remind me of dreams not yet fulfilled. Dad keeps asking, "What's next after leaving your MBA?" and frankly, I have no answer. So, I dodge these uncomfortable encounters.

Mentally, my dreams stretch beyond these walls—I crave adventures with just my car, my dog, and the open roads leading to mountains and nature. I want to earn enough to free my parents from all financial worries, and then quietly slip away to live peacefully surrounded by nature and my pets, absorbing life’s experiences fully.

Every failure I've encountered pushes me into deep contemplation, dissecting each misstep and determining how to restart better. *Society loves winners or those who spectacularly fail, ignoring everyone stuck in the middle.* This harsh truth motivates me to hustle hard, determined not to be just another unknown, middle-class dreamer. Deep inside, I yearn for recognition as a nobody—understood only by fellow introverts.

One proud moment stands out vividly—bringing home Harry, my puppy, without seeking permission or weighing the risks. Despite initial hurdles, Harry became family, a joyful distraction for my parents. Seeing them happy, engaging with Harry like he was their own child, was profoundly fulfilling.

A small daily ritual anchors me: **starting my day with a healthy smoothie and a solid workout**. These habits keep me grounded, providing clarity even on difficult days. Skipping them feels like neglecting something critical, and each morning, they motivate me to wake early and respect my physical and mental well-being.

Future Tushar, if you're ever lost again, first reread the <b>Bhagavad Gita</b>. Next, take deep, mindful breaths—it works like magic. Sit quietly under nature, let your mind wander deeply, then nap. Trust your instincts deeply; your inner voice is wiser and stronger than you realize. And, most importantly, never care what people say; your performance is for yourself and the universe alone.

I've repeated mistakes, especially smoking, first because it felt cool, then because it was a stubborn habit. I've learned to handle it better each relapse, noticing triggers and finding healthier replacements. Each failure taught me something invaluable about myself, strengthening my resolve each time.

**My parents are my greatest blessing.** We've seen poverty, hopeless nights wondering about our next meal, yet they sacrificed to provide for us. Even now, during my struggles, they stand with me, patiently hopeful. My ultimate dream is to make them comfortable and proud, then quietly retreat to a tranquil life with animals and nature.

<b>When future obstacles seem overwhelming, remember:</b>  
Pause, breathe, rest, and remind yourself why you're here. Every moment of confusion eventually passes.

Never abandon our shared dream—once financially stable and your parents content, build a home in the mountains, isolated but peacefully fulfilled. Your struggles today ensure the future freedom you crave. *Remember, every stumble is temporary; you're only down if you choose to stay down.* I look forward to rereading this blog someday, smiling proudly at our journey.

Forgive me for not starting earlier, for copying others rather than embracing authenticity, and for the friendships I didn’t nurture. Thank you for your patience. Stay proud, knowing every delay shaped your eventual success.

In moments of triumph, remember these days nostalgically—the struggles, Harry's comforting presence, the mistakes that taught you resilience, even cigarettes that momentarily helped cope (just kidding!). Stay grounded, remembering vividly where you started compared to where you now stand.

Your Past Self
