It’s 2:47 AM, and—guess what—I’m scrolling again.  
Not for anything important. Just the usual doomscroll: stories, reels, memes, news I won’t remember in the morning.  
By now, it’s kind of my routine.

## Why Am I Even Awake Right Now?

> **“People say ‘just sleep early’, but nobody tells you how to shut your mind off when the whole world’s online.”**

In my city, mornings mean activity—everyone does things early, before the heat sets in. By the time I roll out of bed (11 am, give or take), half the day is gone. Most days I wake up feeling like I missed something, even though I was technically awake most of the night.

This wasn’t always the case.  
It started when I got my own phone.  
First, it was chatting late with friends. Then scrolling feeds, exploring random pages. Somewhere along the way, sleep just slipped out the back door.

I thought I was in control. “I’ll just watch one more video.” Famous last words.  
It’s not just the phone, honestly. There’s a kind of restlessness in my generation. FOMO, mind racing, that urge to keep checking—what if you miss something?  
(If you’re lucky enough not to know FOMO, [read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out).)

## My Toxic Routine (Relatable? Let’s See)

- Grab my phone before I even open my other eye.
- Scroll on the toilet (let’s be real), pretending I’m “catching up”, just making myself late for everything else.
- By the time I eat, it’s brunch—random, heavy, usually not healthy. Hygiene? Let’s not talk about it.
- Food coma. More scrolling. Maybe a nap.
- Some days, convince myself to work, but the phone’s always close. If you think this sounds like a mess, you’re right.
- Evenings are for “rewarding” myself—junk food, chilling with friends who honestly add zero value.  
- Then at night, back to the phone. Looking for…something. Dopamine, maybe. (Read about that here: [Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/1524746746?crid=3U71EIK4BH5T4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ACpOuV6wP-0Zj4Bw6nNbitWIC-GHU9u7vRGFaewkSABCbxqPr51XqmP5VBaTzxwpjzYTBqs0evRs0l1YSebdFmOp5aXVlxP83T6mkxUh3WGE64tYow2nCjVgxABg7F1A_DMZPoES5rjbMX_w4Llx9j0ax547hiUK3C5ihwaTnYcdV8y-J0mRWcqOXD-s6IsaIE4EDqXsawomHkWkduU4mxC4mAfvjnIWaXeofWEGD00.c_WG1WOavbR7OodtLf_yMxY23tJqQxGbsC9HOSY5V1k&dib_tag=se&keywords=dopamine+nation+by+dr.+anna+lembke&qid=1751993401&sprefix=dopamine+na%2Caps%2C547&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=tushar12074-20&linkId=e32d2f191971bdfeefdc40d6549a3ad4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).)
- Try to sleep, but brain replays old chats, future plans, regrets, that one thing I said wrong years ago.
- Sometimes sad songs, sometimes just lying there.
- Eventually, doomscrolling wins.  
- Sleep? 3 am, if I’m lucky.

## What Actually Helped Me (No Motivational BS)

### 1. **Deleted Instagram.**  
Felt like quitting sugar. The urge was strong, but after a week I didn’t miss it. Screen time dropped. Still picked up my phone out of habit, but there was less to scroll.

### 2. **Dropped Toxic Friends.**  
If you have to force a friendship, it’s not a friendship. I stopped replying, stopped picking calls. They forgot me faster than I expected. My mind actually got quieter.

### 3. **Swapped Bad Habits for Less-Bad Ones.**  
Smoking → chocolate.  
Alcohol → banana shake.  
Porn → dating apps (not perfect, but better).  
None of these are perfect solutions, but I had to start somewhere.

### 4. **Fixed My Food, Slowly.**  
YouTube is full of health advice. I started watching more food content, got obsessed with protein, tried to eat on time. Cheated sometimes. Not a saint. But things got better.

### 5. **Home Workout.**  
Gym? Nah, too many people. I got some dumbbells, started at home. Consistency was (and still is) the real struggle, but when you start seeing progress, it hits different.

### 6. **Water. Simple, But It Works.**  
I keep bottles everywhere now—bed, desk, kitchen. Every time I think I need a break, I drink.

### 7. **Meditation.**  
Read somewhere that meditation helps with sleep ([Meditation that works for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIbgSN2qAU)), so I gave it a shot. At first, it did nothing. After a month, something clicked. I started treating sleep like meditation: just close my eyes and let my brain “log off.” Not always easy, but better than before.

## My Life Now

These days, I wake up at 7 am, no phone for at least half an hour (unless there’s a fire).  
Drink water, sunlight, short walk.  
Eat on time. Try to keep the phone at a distance while I work.  
Evenings, I walk my dog—sometimes the best conversations are with someone who can’t talk back.  
Before bed, I cool down my room, dim the lights, and meditate (or at least pretend to).  
I don’t always fall asleep fast. But I don’t spiral as much. Most nights, I sleep deep.

## No 5-Step Formula—Just a Real Story

I won’t pretend this is some neat “system” that fixes your life overnight. I’m still figuring it out.  
But here’s the truth: the digital world is designed to keep us awake, and if you’re not stubborn about your sleep, nobody else will care.

If you’re still reading this at 2:47 am, maybe it’s time to put your phone down and give your mind a break.  
(Or, okay, read [one more of my blogs](/blog/30-days-no-instagram) before you go—no shame.)

**Sleep isn’t a luxury. It’s the one thing your brain needs if you want to do anything with your life.**

I’m not an expert, I’m just tired of being tired.

**Sleep well (or at least try).**
