When my parents gave me my first personal room, I felt an exhilarating freedom. Initially, I decorated it enthusiastically—new bed sheets, a stylish clock to keep track of study hours, and a desk with a comfy chair. Being introverted, I quickly turned my room into a playground of distractions. I added motivational posters, multiple speakers in every corner, various LED lights, and even installed a locker for my personal items—earphones, perfumes, diaries. I was fascinated with personalizing everything, including my computer setup. That was me in 2018, class 11, lost in excitement and clutter.

Fast forward to today, and my views have changed drastically. Experience and failures taught me the beauty and value of minimalism. Minimalism is deceptive; it looks easy but requires tremendous effort behind the scenes. Just like creating a sleek website—smooth and clean on the surface, but complicated and cluttered behind the scenes. Simplifying complex things is challenging yet rewarding.

My journey towards minimalism began in the quietness of village life. Living in a city near villages allowed me easy escapes to simplicity. Initially, societal biases led me to undervalue village life. Cities were always portrayed as superior. However, my travels changed my perception. I began appreciating the tranquility of villages—clean air, the peaceful interaction among people, and the simplicity of village evenings compared to the noisy city evenings. Observing how villagers built simple, functional homes as opposed to cluttered urban dwellings inspired me profoundly.

This realization was my turning point—I was inspired to embrace minimalism in my own life. I began by rethinking everything around me, constantly questioning how things could be simpler. My first real test came with an e-commerce website project. I learned to break down complexity into simplicity, though it wasn't always easy.

At first, minimalism faced resistance—from family, friends, and even myself. Many misunderstood my pursuit as unnecessary rebellion. The hardest part was deciding what to keep and what to discard, as everything seemed important. I managed by tackling one small step at a time, celebrating each minor achievement.

To practically implement minimalism, I unlearned societal expectations. I began with my room—removing clutter, painting walls white, using only black and white essentials. I simplified my wardrobe to just navy blue and black, removing the daily stress of deciding what to wear. My workspace now consists of a simple plastic chair and a clutter-free desk with no distractions.

Minimizing my social interactions was equally crucial. I distanced myself from toxic friendships and unnecessary distractions, making room for focus and growth. This wasn't easy but necessary. It cleared my mind, improved my focus, and reduced stress significantly.

Implementing minimalism on a budget taught me valuable lessons. I noticed many people complicate minimalism by spending money on unnecessary aesthetics. For instance, rather than decorating my balcony, I simply cleared it and placed water pots, attracting birds naturally and capturing beautiful, minimalist moments effortlessly—something villagers do effortlessly.

As my physical space became simpler, so did my thoughts. Without the clutter of unnecessary decisions, I gained clarity and focus. My parents and friends noticed these changes; I maintained emotional connections while avoiding distractions. It wasn’t selfish; it was necessary for growth.

Minimalism helped me realize how society sells simplicity packaged in complexity, often monetizing basic peace and tranquility. Ironically, people pay to experience simple village-like lifestyles, fresh air, open spaces, or meditation retreats, all naturally abundant yet undervalued in village life.

Today, visitors immediately notice the calm simplicity of my room—a minimal, colorless space I deeply cherish. My advice for anyone wanting to start minimalism is to identify what distracts you most and begin decluttering there. Understand the essence of simplicity and peace, internally and externally.

In embracing minimalism, I found profound lessons. Our ancestors lived simple, focused lives, prioritizing essentials like food and shelter. Modern society, in contrast, thrives on complexity, often unnecessarily. Recognizing this helped me connect deeply to my roots and find genuine peace.
