## The Return of the Boatman

After spending four days with Ram, Sita, and Lakshman,  
the sailor(निषादराज) finally bid them farewell and crossed the Ganga back.  

On his way, he met **Sumanth** — Dashrath’s loyal sevak —  
and narrated everything that had happened:  
Ram’s calmness, Sita’s devotion, Lakshman’s loyalty,  
and the way they vanished into the forest like the sun setting behind the hills.  

Hearing this, Sumanth’s heart sank.  
He feared returning alone.  
> What will I say to Ayodhya?  
How will I face the king without Ram?

That night, he reached near **Tamsa River**,  
sat quietly beneath a tree,  
and waited for darkness to enter Ayodhya unseen.  

He knew if people saw him return alone,  
the kingdom would erupt in pain.  

Under the silent stars, he slipped into the city,  
and then into the palace.

## The Last Breath of a King

Inside the royal chambers, **Dashrath** lay on the ground —    
his lips whispering, *"Ram… Sita… Lakshman…"* again and again.  

Sumanth knelt beside him and softly told him  
everything about the four days of exile 
Ram’s composure, Sita’s courage, Lakshman’s service for Ram.  

When he finished, Dashrath turned his eyes upward 

> I see him… I see Ram.

He gasped, shivered,  
and with Ram’s name still on his tongue  
the king left the world.  

That night, Ayodhya drowned in silence.  
Every major people gathered that night.

### ✨ Reflection

> Dashrath didn’t die of age or war.  
> He died of love. love for his family. love for his eldest son.

## The Summoning of Bharat

The next dawn, sages and priests began preparations for the king’s last rites.  
**Guru Vishwamitra** ordered his disciples —  
> Ride the fastest horses. Bring Bharat and Shatrughna from Kaikey’s father’s palace.  
Do not tell them what has happened.

When Bharat arrived, an uneasiness weighed on him.  
The streets were quiet, people’s faces pale.  

At the gate stood **Kaikeyi**, smiling, with an aarti plate —  
ready as if for celebration.

## The Confrontation

Bharat bowed, then asked softly,  
> Where is Father?  
Where is Mother Kaushalya?  
And where is Ram? 

Kaikeyi’s smile faded.  
In a single breath, she said,  
> Your father is no more.  
Manthra and I fulfilled the promises   
Ram is in exile, and the throne is yours. and she smiled. 

Bharat froze.  
The world spun.  

He fell to the ground, speechless.  
After a long pause, he looked at her with fire in his eyes:  
> You traded dharma for desire,  
and called it love.

Manthra entered, dressed in celebration, her face bright with pride.  
Before she could speak, **Shatrughna**, furious,  
struck her down — kicking her so hard that blood stained the marble.  
He dragged her by her hair toward the courtyard until Bharat stopped him.  

> "Enough," Bharat said. "Let her live with her curse."  
Then he turned to Kaikeyi:  
> "Mother, from today never show me your face.

## Kaushalya’s Sorrow

Bharat and Shatrughna went to **Queen Kaushalya’s chamber**.  
The room was dark; her crown and jewelry lay untouched.  
She looked pale, weakened by grief.  

When she saw Bharat, she tried to stand but collapsed.  
He caught her in his arms.  

> "Where is Ram? Where is Sita?" he asked.  

Through tears, Kaushalya told him everything —  
from the promises to the exile.  

That whole night, Bharat and Shatrughna sat beside her in silence.  
Even words seemed too heavy to speak.

## The King’s Last Rites

At dawn, **Guru Vashishtha** came to Bharat and said gently,  
> Rise, my son. Perform your father’s last rites.

Wiping his tears, Bharat stood tall  
and for the first time, looked like a king.  

He led the entire ceremony with grace and devotion,  
offering his father’s soul peace with the name of Ram on his lips.  

When the fire calmed, Bharat folded his hands and whispered:  
> I will live only to bring him back.

---

### ✨ Reflection

> True power isn’t sitting on a throne.  
> It’s the strength to reject it for what’s right.

---

## The Panchayat of Ayodhya

Later, the royal court gathered.  
The sages, elders, and queens all urged Bharat to take the throne.  

> Your father wished it.  
Until Ram returns, rule in his name.

But Bharat shook his head,  
his eyes steady, his voice calm:  
> I will not.  
This kingdom belongs to Ram.  
I will go to the forest and bring him home.

His words filled the court with silence   
and then, with hope.

**Guru Vashishtha** nodded.  
> Then prepare. We leave at dawn.

## The Journey Begins

By sunrise, the kingdom awakened.  
Elephants, horses, and royal palanquins lined the roads.  
Queens, ministers, and villagers gathered   
everyone wanting to see Ram once more.  

Bharat ordered whoever wants to see ram. 
let them come with us.

Bharat stood before the chariot,  
his heart steady, his purpose clear.  

> No one is forced, he said. But if your heart calls for Ram — come. 

The sound of drums echoed,  

And so, the royal caravan began its journey 
toward the forests,   
toward the one who had left everything behind.

In the next part you get to know about the journey and great meeting or Bharat with Ram
