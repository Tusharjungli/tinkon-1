## What's in a Name?

First things first: why "Tinkon"? The name blends my identity (Tushar), the playful energy of "tink," and my never-ending habit of overthinking. It echoes "think on," something that I've spent countless hours doing—perhaps too many.

## The Spark

Two years after graduation, I found myself continuously failing. MBA entrance exams, certificate courses, stock markets—you name it. My self-esteem took a beating, but I was stubborn. I had this overwhelming feeling that I needed to stand out. Being just another employee wasn't something I could settle for.

Being the eldest child, family expectations were sky-high. I desperately sought satisfaction, plunging into self-help books, biographies, and even programming. But nothing clicked.

I left social media, isolated myself, and dove into study. Being an introvert didn't help much either—my small circle shrank even further, intensifying feelings of loneliness and frustration.

## Taking Risks

At my lowest point, I realized something crucial: I had nothing left to lose (apart from disappointing my parents further). It was the perfect moment to take risks. I decided, stubbornly, that each failure would only teach me more.

Sitting in front of my laptop for 7-8 hours daily, I decided to spill all the chaos inside my head onto the screen. And thus, Tinkon was born.

## The First Step

Oddly enough, my first step wasn't code—it was colors. I knew exactly what vibe I wanted: soothing, minimal, nostalgic yet modern. Clean, aesthetic, readable. No clutter, just clarity.

I spent hours researching palettes, typography, and layout inspirations. Pinterest became my best friend, helping me envision the site even before writing the first line of code. The process was therapeutic; each aesthetic choice felt like reclaiming control from a life that felt utterly chaotic.

## Funny Mishap

Funny story—I spent two days coding and confidently pushing to GitHub, expecting magical auto-deployment. But nothing happened. Turned out, I'd been pushing to the wrong repository entirely! Lesson learned: double-check your URLs.

I laughed out loud when I realized my mistake, partly from embarrassment, partly because it felt like a metaphor for my life—constantly pushing energy in one direction, only to discover later that I was on the wrong track entirely.

## Emotional Battles

The hardest part wasn't the technical side—it was opening myself up to the world. Sharing your story when you're naturally introverted feels chaotic, terrifying even. But I took that risk, thinking, "Who cares? Maybe it'll help someone else."

I vividly remember hesitating to hit the publish button for the first time. My heart raced, palms sweating. "What if nobody cares? What if they judge me harshly?" I asked myself. But deep inside, I knew vulnerability was key—authenticity mattered more than comfort.

## The Moment of Truth

Seeing Tinkon.in finally live on the internet was a surreal, satisfying experience. It felt like a real step forward after endless setbacks. Each failure, each misstep, had led to this. I stared at the screen, refreshed it repeatedly, and each time it loaded, I felt a jolt of pride and disbelief. "Did I really create this?" I wondered.

## The Role of a Tail-Wagging Friend

Throughout this rollercoaster ride, my Golden Retriever became my emotional anchor. Whenever sadness crept in, his playful tail wagging instantly distracted me. Sometimes, that's all you need—a joyful interruption. There were countless late nights when coding frustrations were interrupted by a soft bark or a playful nudge. Those moments reminded me that while my goals mattered, happiness was found in the smallest of moments.

## My Dream for Tinkon

I envision Tinkon as a platform where others can meet the real, imperfect me, learn from my constant failures, and share their own stories. I dream of building a community that understands and grows together. Maybe, just maybe, someone struggling like I did will stumble upon my story and feel a bit less alone.

## Advice to My Younger Self

If I could rewind, I'd tell myself: "Don't take school too seriously." School taught me to fear failure, to seek security, and to fit in. But real growth lies in risking, failing, and discovering on your own. School labels failure as a disaster; life showed me it's my greatest teacher.
