Life was blissful back in 3rd grade. School was fun, lunch was tasty, and Doraemon was my daily companion—a cartoon making every afternoon magical. Sleeping deeply and waking refreshed, only to run outside and play with friends was pure happiness.

But everything shattered when I stepped into 7th grade—a prestigious new school, the best in the city, or so they claimed. Ironically, this "top school" had a playground only on paper. In reality, there was no sport, no physical activity, just books, and marks. It marked the beginning of my physical downfall—I became obese, a situation unimaginable in my playful past.

Suddenly academics dominated my life, and it wasn't gentle. Poor marks were met with disappointment, embarrassment, and humiliation. Teachers offered a solution: more tuition. No one ever told me failure could be a good teacher. Nobody encouraged exploring beyond the curriculum or truly understanding concepts. It was a never-ending race for marks and grades, a trap that captured us all.

*"Take more Tuitions. Never fail."*


I was genuinely good at languages, truly interested and talented. But instead of nurturing this passion, my school pressured me to excel in every subject. As I struggled to improve in subjects I disliked, I began to fail even in languages, the one area where I was confident. It crushed my spirit. Soon, I believed I was truly mediocre, devoid of talent or interests. By the 10th grade, even occasional good marks felt meaningless, overshadowed by the feeling that everyone else had done better.

Sadly, no school taught us courage. Instead, they cultivated fear.

By the end of the 10th grade, my health and mental well-being were damaged under this relentless pressure. Yet, something began to stir inside me. 
The **education system was controlling me, limiting my growth.**

11th grade became my rebellion. I ventured beyond school, diving into computers, internet exploration, and physical fitness. Yet the system fought back harshly—I was *deliberately failed*. My teacher's words still ring painfully in my ears: *"Your life is hell now. You’ll need my tuition to pass."* Imagine saying that to a 16-year-old—someone still discovering life.

That moment was my wake-up call. I switched schools, repeated the 11th standard, and found real freedom and exploration. I experienced the true rush of teenage life. I discovered life offered more than rote learning; there were businesses, passions, hobbies, and endless possibilities beyond traditional schooling.

However, old fears lingered. My parents, still under the education system's influence, feared risks. Schools train you to become corporate puppets, constantly nodding yes without raising your head. They instill risk-aversion from the start—providing buses so you avoid walking, cycling, and *real-world interactions*.

I, however, learned valuable life lessons cycling daily to school, meeting policemen, vendors, mechanics—people offering wisdom beyond textbooks. The school wanted my head down; life taught me otherwise.

Looking back now, I see how the education system conditioned us to fear risk and failure. But recently, I've embraced **risk-taking** and failure as vital parts of growth. Over the past two years, I've taken risks that brought me here, openly sharing my thoughts. I've actively unlearned school-imposed limitations. Without schools holding me back, I could've achieved much more.

Even in my MBA interviews, the same pattern emerged. Interviewers expected fluent English, perfect answers, polished speech—qualities suitable for *job candidates* but not entrepreneurs or innovators. Real education doesn't exist in traditional classrooms or MBA programs; they groom you for corporate roles, making you just another puppet.

True education lies in taking risks early and learning from failures. *Failure is life's best teacher, offering unmatched lessons. Schools might teach skills, but rarely practical,* real-world applications. They condition you for jobs, not entrepreneurship or real-life success.

My honest advice to younger me or to parents today: **"Give your children only basic education, then let them explore the real world. Let them fall, fail, and struggle. Only through this will they truly learn survival skills, understand who genuinely matters, and discern good from bad."**

And remember humorously:

**Life’s greatest lessons never came from classrooms; they came from living boldly and learning from failure.**
