## Why I Hate School (And What I Wish I Knew Sooner)

**You don’t have to love school to learn from it.** This isn’t just a rant—it’s a survival guide for anyone who feels trapped by grades, pressure, or the “rat race” of education.

### My Story: From Doraemon to Detention

Life was blissful back in 3rd grade. School was fun, lunch was tasty, and Doraemon was my daily companion—a cartoon making every afternoon magical. Sleeping deeply and waking refreshed, only to run outside and play with friends was pure happiness.

But everything shattered in 7th grade—a “top” school with *no* playground and all pressure. Suddenly, my world shrank to books and marks. I got obese, my confidence tanked, and life felt like a never-ending exam.

### When School Hurts More Than It Helps

Poor marks? That meant disappointment and humiliation—not help. The only advice? “More tuition.”  
No one said **failure can be a teacher**, or that real learning sometimes means falling behind before leaping ahead.

*“Take more Tuitions. Never fail.”*

Worse, my real talent—language—was ignored. I had to be “good at everything.” Soon, even my strengths became weaknesses, and by 10th grade, I believed I was just... mediocre.  
If you’re reading this and feel the same, you are *not alone*.

But school never taught courage—they taught fear.

### The Moment I Broke Free

By 11th grade, the pressure broke me. I rebelled. Computers, internet, gym—anything but “marks.” For this, I was *deliberately failed* (“You’ll need my tuition to pass!”).  
It was cruel. But that was my wake-up call.

**So I switched schools.**  
For the first time, I saw life outside the box: business, friends, hobbies, street smarts—not just textbooks.

#### 👉 **Quick Takeaway:**  
> **If you feel stuck in school, remember: There are always other paths. Don’t let one system define your worth.**

### What School Never Teaches (But Life Does)

Parents worry, schools want conformity. But **real growth** comes from risk, struggle, and real-world experience.

- I learned more cycling to school than in any class: how to talk to people, deal with trouble, and handle failure.
- Schools train you for safe jobs, not *bold lives*.

### The Hard Truth About Education

Most of us are taught to be risk-averse, to say yes, and to follow rules.  
But **failure is life’s best teacher**—not something to avoid.

> **Practical Advice:**  
> - Don’t fear failing a subject or a class; fear never trying new things.
> - Push yourself outside of academics: side projects, freelancing, clubs, sports, or even making a website (like I did).
> - Talk about your struggles—they are more common than you think.

### My MBA Experience: More of the Same

Even in my MBA interviews, it was about perfect answers and flawless English—not real ideas.  
*Real education is learning how to learn, not just how to perform.*

## **What I’d Tell My Younger Self (Or Any Parent)**

- **Let your kids fail.** Let them struggle. Support them but let them learn real skills.
- **School is just a start, not a finish line.**  
- **Encourage curiosity, not just grades.**
- **Be there for them when they fall, not just when they succeed.**

## **FAQ: Real Questions About School, Learning, and Growth**

**Q: What if I feel like a failure at school?**  
A: *You are not your grades. Failure is feedback. Find what excites you and double down—even if it’s not rewarded in school.*

**Q: How do I support my kid who hates school?**  
A: *Listen, don’t judge. Encourage learning outside the classroom—coding, art, sports, whatever sparks curiosity.*

**Q: Is tuition always necessary?**  
A: *No. Sometimes, more tuition is a bandaid. Try helping your child find meaning and interest first.*
