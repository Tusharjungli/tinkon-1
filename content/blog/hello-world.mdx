# Hello World 👋

**This is not just my first blog post—it’s me, Tushar, stepping out of my head and into the world.**

Welcome to *Tink On It*.  
If you’ve landed here, you probably know what it feels like to overthink, to want something different, or to just find a corner of the internet where you can breathe for a second.

> Writing is like talking to yourself, except you hope someone else overhears and says, ‘Hey, me too!’

## Why Am I Here?
I started this blog for one simple reason: my brain wouldn’t stop buzzing. After too many years of running after exams, job titles, and other people’s expectations, I realized my thoughts deserved a place outside my head.

- Here, I’ll share stories—some funny, some awkward, some a little too real.
- You’ll get a mix of life lessons, honest rants, late-night dog cuddles, and maybe even some advice I wish I could give my younger self.

## What to Expect?
- No filters.
- No “10 Ways to Be Productive Before Sunrise” (unless my dog wakes me up).
- Just genuine stories, curiosity, and maybe a few typos because hey, I’m still human.

## Let’s Do This
Whether you’re here to read, relate, or just procrastinate, I’m glad you stopped by.  
Drop your thoughts or just say hi—I read every message (even the weird ones).

**Welcome to my messy, honest, introverted little corner.**
