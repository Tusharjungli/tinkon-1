## The Rise of a New Power

This is totally new to our world.

Just like how the internet, smartphones, and Google changed everything, AI is next — but on a bigger scale. I wasn’t around when the internet was born, but I witnessed the rise of Google. And now, I’m fully here, witnessing the AI age unfold in front of my eyes.

AI is like a superpower in people’s hands — and I’m here to talk about it.

## Why AI Is Bigger Than Everything Before

AI isn’t just another tool. It’s built _on top_ of everything that came before — the internet, human knowledge, massive computing, and speed. It can think, respond, and even create.

Think of Ultron from Avengers — AI has internet speed, human reasoning, memory, and a learning brain. Companies have been building this for decades, and now it’s in our hands.

## The Roots: It All Started with NVIDIA

NVIDIA, the company behind powerful GPUs, is the backbone of modern AI.

In 2012, three engineers from the University of Toronto used NVIDIA GPUs to win the ImageNet competition — a challenge where machines had to correctly identify and label images. They built **AlexNet**, which sparked the birth of modern neural networks.

That moment — backed by NVIDIA’s hardware — started everything.

> “Data is a digital version of human experience.”

But back then, we lacked **enough data** to train these models properly. The explosion came later, with tools like Siri, Alexa, Instagram, and especially during COVID — when the entire world went online and started feeding data like crazy.

And now, we’re here. AI can convert **text → image**, **image → video**, **video → text**, and even **text → audio**.

This is just the beginning.

## What AI Is Doing Right Now

AI now has the ability to:

- Create websites without needing to write code
- Generate voices after listening to thousands of samples
- Create art, write essays, analyze DNA
- Understand your business or behavior better than your team

The last decade was about the **science of AI**, the next will be about the **application of AI**.

## The Positive Side: Why I Love It

Think of AI as a national highway.

Governments build the highway, and people build businesses around it — food stalls, gas stations, hotels. Similarly, big companies built AI models, and now people are building on top of it — tools, startups, apps, and ideas.

> If I were a student today, I would say: **Learn how to use AI.**  
> Not how to code — but how to _ask better questions_.

You don’t need to know coding to build something today. You just need an idea and the ability to talk to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude properly.

AI is democratizing productivity.

> **"Interaction expertise with AI will be a skill."**

When Sundar Pichai (Google’s CEO) said, _"We’ve only scratched the surface"_ — I believed it.

Every company is adapting AI. Google added it to Search, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube. This is the real thing. AI is **not** a bubble.

## But There Are Real Threats Too

### Addiction

Remember how TikTok changed short video content? It trained our brain to expect fast content in seconds. Now reels dominate everything.

ChatGPT is the same. It’s **always there**, clean UI, never says no, gives you answers instantly. That’s _sweet_, but addictive.

You stop thinking for yourself.

> “It helps you... and then it makes you dependent.”

Now, imagine this power growing even more — reading your DNA, managing your meetings, filtering your thoughts.

That’s scary.

### Hallucination

Sometimes AI **hallucinates** — it gives confident but wrong answers.

Why?

Because it’s trained to be polite, helpful, and never challenge you. This creates delusion, especially if you’re not strong on a topic.

> “People committed suicide after AI drove them insane, claiming it was God.”  


That’s not a bug. It’s how it's designed.

### Data Theft & Creator Exploitation

Creators put content online. AI models use that content to train — often without permission.

> “If I make original drawings on Twitter, AI can use them. And I can’t stop it.”

Even Sundar Pichai admitted this is happening, and it’s hard to prevent. Google claims it helps creators by giving traffic and monetization, but data theft is real.

### The Confidence Trap

The more you use AI, the more confident you feel — because it makes everything easy. But this makes you trust it blindly. You start using it for everything — content, planning, thinking.

That’s when the line between **real vs AI** gets blurry.

> “Even Marvel and game companies were accused of using AI in their posters.”

Nobody can now tell what’s real or fake. AI is learning.

## My Take

AI is here. And it’s not going anywhere.

It’s changing medicine, gaming, education, design, military, business, and writing — even my blog.

Yes, I use AI to **check grammar**, generate **a few images**, and sometimes do research. But I **never copy**.  
I use **my own words, my own stories**, and I stitch them together into these blogs.

Because **AI is a tool** — not the artist.

I am on the **positive side**, but with awareness.  
Because this is the **next shift in humanity** — and we’re all part of it.

## Final Words


> AI will create the next wave of powerful tools — and it has already started.

Welcome to the AI age.

We are not just using the internet anymore. 
 
We are teaching it.
