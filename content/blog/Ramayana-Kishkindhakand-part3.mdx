Reading this, I realized that sometimes the journey stops only to awaken who we truly are.*

## Searching Without Rest

The vanaras searched everywhere 
trees, mountains, caves, ponds, valleys.  

They moved without caring for their health,  
without counting days or strength.  

Hanuman watched from above 
from treetops and mountain peaks(Beceause he was tallest from all vanaras).  

He saw something bad:  
the vanaras were thirsty, exhausted and surrounded by land without water.

So he climbed higher.

From a distant peak, Hanuman noticed smoke rising far away,  
birds circling one place again and again.  

A sign of life.

## The Cave of Illusion 

Hanuman led the group to the cave.  
The vanaras were afraid therefore Hanuman entered first.

Inside was something unexpected:  
a garden full of fruits,  
a clear pond of fresh water,  
and a woman guarding a small temple.

Hanuman bowed and told her everything  
why they were there,  
what they were searching,  
why time was running out for them.

The woman listened silently.

She asked them to eat, drink and rest.  
Then she said:

> Close your eyes.  
> When I tell you, walk forward and do not open them no matter what.

They obeyed.

When they opened their eyes again,  
they were standing at the edge of the **Lavansagar**  
the vast ocean.

And the woman had vanished.

### ✨ Reflection

## Fear at the Edge of the Ocean

Time was running so fast.  
There was no trace of Sita.

Angad finally spoke what everyone feared:

> We cannot go back.  
> Sugreev will kill us if we fail.

Nobody speaking.

They sat on the shore  
defeated, hungry, hopeless.

Death felt closer than success.

---

## Jambvant and the Name of Ram

Jambvant (An old bear) was sad too.

He spoke:

> Remember Ram.  
> He is not an ordinary man.  
> He will not abandon us.

Those words were heard by someone else.

---

## Sampati, the Fallen Eagle

From a nearby cave came **Sampati** 
an enormous eagle, broken-winged, old, towering like a mountain.

He saw the vanaras and thought:  
*So much food today.*

The vanaras scattered in fear.

But when Sampati heard the name **Ram**,  
he stopped.

Angad spoke of **Jatayu** 
and Sampati remembered.

He asked to be taken near the ocean  
to pray for his brother.

Then Sampati told his story 
how pride once made him fly toward the sun,  
how he lost his wing,  
and how a sage told him:

> Serve the needy and you will be healed.

---

## The First Real Clue

Sampati revealed the truth:

> On **Trikut Mountain**,  
> there is a kingdom called **Lanka**.  
> Sita is in **Ashok Vatika** of **Lanka**.

He could see it (Eagles are farsighted) 
but he could not fly anymore.

Then he said something crucial:

> Only one who has the power to cross this ocean  
> and the wisdom to enter Lanka  
> can help Ram.

And with that, Sampati returned to his cave.

---

## Who Is Capable?

The vanaras began questioning themselves.

Jambvant spoke:

> In my youth, I could cross this ocean.  
> But age has taken my strength.

He turned to Angad.

Angad replied:

> I can cross…  
> but I am not sure if I can return.

Then Jambvant noticed Hanuman 
silent, unmoving and staring at the ocean.

---

## Awakening of Hanuman

Jambvant called out:

> Wake up, Hanuman.  
> Your birth is for Ram.

Again and again, he reminded him.
Other vanaras also pushing him.

And something shifted.

Hanuman remembered his strength.  
His purpose.  
His devotion.

He asked only one thing:

> Show me the way.

Jambvant replied:

> Go.  
> Find Sita.  
> Do not bring her here.  
> Return and tell Ram with your own mouth.

Hanuman bowed.

And with that,  
the path ahead was clear.

---

## End of Kishkindha Kand

Tulsidas ends Kishkindha Kand here 
with Hanuman as a main character now.

Because sometimes,  
the ocean doesn’t block the way.  
It reveals who **must** cross it.
