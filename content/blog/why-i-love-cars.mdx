I don't need a love story. I need a good road, a full tank, and an excuse to drive at midnight. A moody playlist, windows rolled up, and my thoughts as my only passengers. Cars are no longer just machines—they're escape pods. In a world where silence is rare, cars give me exactly that. Especially at night, and especially when the weather is cloudy.

  Cars aren't just machines. They're freedom, escape, therapy, and sometimes heartbreak—all rolled on four wheels.

## How It All Started: Grease, Gears & Childhood

My love for cars began early—my father ran a garage where I watched grease-stained hands revive lifeless engines. I played in Maruti 800s, Esteems, old Ambassadors, and open-roof jeeps. I’d pretend to drive them, shifting gears without keys, imagining I was flying.

I begged my father to teach me how to drive. He never did. Over time, the garage shut down, life moved on, and cars quietly faded from our lives. But the connection? Never left.

## Rediscovering My Passion

College reignited the spark. Modified cars with bass systems and tinted windows roared into campus. Then came *Fast and Furious*, and I finally understood: cars can be *emotional*. For men especially, they’re not just transport—they're therapy.

My father never wanted me in the automobile world again. But stubbornness runs in the family. I wasn’t just chasing cars. I was chasing *feelings*.

## Learning the Language of Cars

I dove into horsepower, torque, wheelbase, RPMs. For once, something from school—torque in physics—clicked practically. I like to explain it this way:

> Horsepower is how fast you hit the wall.  
> Torque is how far you push it after.

I truly understood this during a mountain road trip. Our car broke down. Driving that half-damaged vehicle taught me more about cars than YouTube ever could. That’s why I always say [failure is the mother of all teachers](/blog/failing-everything).

## The YouTube Era: From F1 to Engine Obsession

YouTube took over. My feed became an F1 tech lab. I learned how Formula 1 isn’t just a race—it’s a research project. Things like paddle shifters, traction control, even air pressure sensors? You use them today because F1 used them first. [Read more about that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/).

Some people don’t get it. Why love a machine? I get it. They’ve never driven one alone on a rainy night.

## My Own Car Story: The Interview & Beyond

In an MBA interview, I said I loved cars. The panel asked about North India's 2nd-largest car company. I blanked. Because loving cars isn’t about factory stats—it’s about engines, gears, and emotions.

Right now, I drive a humble middle-class car. But it’s mine. I push its limits. I test my adrenaline. I take midnight highway drives with playlists full of emotion. That car knows me better than most people do.

## Learning to Drive = Learning to Fail

Driving was the fastest thing I learned—thanks to failure. I took the keys, hit the road, failed, panicked, then got better. Side mirrors, rear mirrors, road sense, judgment—it’s real-world awareness at its peak. And no, my dad didn’t teach me. My fear and curiosity did.

## Car Dreams & Garage Redemption

I dream of owning a Porsche. Minimalist design, launch control, performance—it’s art. I've also driven a Porsche 911 once. That was enough to make me a believer. One day, it’ll be mine.

But more than that—I want to restart my father's garage. He gave up on it. I want to bring it back with purpose. I’m working on it alone, and it's tough. But it’ll be my gift to him.

## F1 Tech: The Future Is Already Here

Formula 1 isn’t just racing. It’s innovation on wheels. Things we use now—paddle shifters, telemetry, pressure sensors—came from F1. Want to know where your car’s tech comes from? Start with a Formula 1 pit lane.

## Manual vs Automatic: The Ongoing Love Debate

Manual wins. Every time.

You feel every gear. Every rev. You control performance, power, pace. Automatics may be convenient, but manuals? They’re soul machines. In racing, manuals still hold an edge. This debate is close to my heart, and I could write a full blog just on this.

## Diesel, Petrol, or Electric?

- **Diesel:** Raw power. Nostalgic and reliable. My favorite.
- **Petrol:** Smooth, quick, rollercoaster acceleration.
- **Electric:** Sorry—not yet for me.

Why? Charging time + zero sound = less emotion. EVs are clean and smart, but they don’t *growl*. I want to enjoy petrol & diesel while they last.

## Why I’ll Always Love Cars

Cars calm me down. Especially during rain. Especially at night.

I’ve bonded with cars during breakdowns and breakthroughs. I love V8s, turbos, gear shifters, 4WD monsters. But I also love peace—sitting in the driver’s seat, engine humming, and the world finally silent.

## Final Thoughts

Maybe you love cars too—that’s why you’re still reading. Maybe you have a story. Maybe your car is your escape too.

Either way, I hope this blog gave you something to feel. Something to remember.
