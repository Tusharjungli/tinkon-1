The oldest surviving version of the Ramayana is generally considered to be the Valmiki Ramayana, written in Sanskrit. Most scholars place its earliest origins somewhere between the 7th and 5th centuries BCE. The Ramayana happened in the **Treta Yuga**, which is actually before the Mahabharata. That makes it even harder to know the “truth” because everything was written down much later, and there have been countless iterations, metaphors, and changes in the words over time. So, yes—it’s almost impossible to know the truth, word for word.

But if you zoom out and see the big picture, maybe some things really *are* possible.

**For example:** In the Valmiki Ramayana, there are mentions of different types of flora and fauna—like four-tusked elephants and many plants that are key in Ayurveda. Modern botanists and researchers have actually found that the plants, trees, and flowers mentioned by Valmiki exist and are native to the very regions described in the epic. This matches up with the rivers, mountains, and forests that show up in the Ramayana. Does this one research paper “prove” that Ramayana happened? Not really—but it’s fascinating.

Let’s go further.

The main characters of Ramayana are, of course, **Ram, Sita, and Lakshman**—the “lords” for many Hindus. Here’s something people don’t realize: just like in Kalyug, where we have some leftover elements from Dwapar Yug (think about the weapons from Mahabharata that supposedly still exist in Kalyug), the Treta Yug also had echoes of Satyug. According to our scriptures, there were gods back then, who used to bless people like Valmiki, giving them the ability to know about things that happened in the lives of Ram and others.

> **Ramayana is basically the biography of Lord Ram. Valmiki never claimed he was writing fiction; he was representing the key events from Ram’s life.**

It’s like any other great biography. For example, everyone talks about the *vanar sena*—the monkey army that helped Ram. But Valmiki never used the word “monkey.” He wrote *vanar*, which just means forest-dweller, a species who lived in the jungle, had tails, were almost human, but wild—maybe something like primitive humans.

Then, there’s the astronomy and archaeology angle. According to Valmiki, Ram was born on the Navami tithi of Shukla Paksha of Chaitra masa (9th day of the waxing moon in Chaitra). The Nakshatra was Punarvasu. The planetary positions—Sun, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus in Aries, Capricorn, Libra, Cancer, and Pisces, with Lagna as Cancer—match up to a date that software today can pinpoint: **January 10th, 5114 BC**, at noon, in Ayodhya. This is exactly when Ram Navami is still celebrated across India today. If nothing else, that’s an incredible astronomical sync.

Let’s not forget the metals and weapons. In Mahabharata, the weapons were made of copper or other metals, and archaeologists have found evidence of such ancient metalwork around Kurukshetra. That’s why Mahabharata is “easier” to believe—it was only about 7,000 years ago. But Ramayana is a different challenge—14,000 years old, maybe.

## Some Wild Theories

In Ramayana, when the vanar sena went east, there was mention of a “mark on the earth” near what we now call South America. People in Peru claim they have an earth mark similar to what’s described in the epic, and they connect it to their own god. That suggests that earth mark could have existed even in Treta Yuga.

There are still so many questions—Ashok Vatika, Ram Setu, Hanuman’s footprints in India and other countries… But here’s the flip side: maybe Ramayana is just a myth. The only version I trust is Valmiki’s Ramayana. Later versions added all sorts of stories, some negative or contradictory. Some people say Ram once killed a young man—but if Ram ruled for 10,000 years, how could someone “bad” rule for so long? It doesn’t make sense.

And what about the *Pushpak Viman*? Ravana’s flying machine. There’s no proof for how it worked, or where its engine was. All we have is a description: a loud noise when it took off, just like a modern airplane. Coincidence?

There are so many books for and against Ramayana, but for me, the real story is Valmiki’s. If you read it closely and go deep, the meaning changes. If you try to map those locations onto the world today, you’ll find Antarctica, Sri Lanka, Japan, Indonesia, and more are all described in the search for Sita. The names might have changed, but the places are real.

And finally: Remember when Krishna’s Dwarka sank after a sudden rise in ocean levels? So many things were lost to the ocean, taking with them evidence that could have proved Ramayana, Mahabharata, and even Akhand Bharat.
