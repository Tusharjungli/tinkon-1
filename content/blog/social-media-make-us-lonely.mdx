Social media gives you the illusion of being everywhere and with everyone—yet you can still feel completely alone in your room.

I left most social media after my first year of college, a decision driven by noticing my unhealthy pattern: 30 minutes of reading, 45 minutes of scrolling, repeat until depleted. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp—the cycle never ended. It gave me nothing lasting, just short bursts of dopamine from memes and snapshots of people seemingly living their best lives.

**Social media constantly showed me polished highlights of everyone's happiest moments, making my life feel dull in comparison.** Scrolling through carefully curated images, I felt increasingly disconnected and dissatisfied. What was meant as a break turned into a reminder of my insecurities.

I learned from books that dopamine operates like a seesaw: push down hard on pleasure, and inevitably you'll swing back up into pain. This explained why the fleeting joy of endless scrolling quickly gave way to emptiness and frustration. I'd feel drained, trapped in a never-ending cycle of short-term pleasure and long-term dissatisfaction.

My life oscillates between two extremes: digital and real-world interactions. Spending a whole day online leaves me feeling isolated and craving genuine human connection. Yet, a full day of socializing often feels like wasted productivity—I miss the clarity and calm of my solitary space. As an introvert, I thrive in solitude, quietly working, brainstorming, and recharging.

**Social media feeds into our primal desire to be noticed and appreciated.** Inspired by celebrities and influencers, I tried sharing my happy moments, expecting validation through likes and comments. When those reactions never matched my expectations, disappointment and self-doubt set in. Eventually, I realized social media is vast and impersonal. People post shocking, seductive, or nostalgic content to attract attention, overshadowing authentic posts from those restricted by family responsibilities, religious norms, or social pressures.


This attraction-driven culture made me understand the harsh reality: unless you provide instant gratification or dopamine hits, you'll likely remain unnoticed. Social media undoubtedly has its benefits—connecting with like-minded people, promoting work, discovering talent—but the clutter and distractions dilute its value. Trying to find genuine connections or meaningful content often feels impossible amidst unrelated memes and sensational posts.

Then there's FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), the invisible thread pulling me back into scrolling. I'd convince myself something important might've been posted, creating a compulsive urge to keep checking. Initially, leaving social media triggered anxiety, but soon I realized the news and content I feared missing rarely mattered. Like the irrelevant news stories I'd obsessively follow, social media content often provided superficial interest without genuine impact on my life.

**Comparing myself to others online became unavoidable.** Seeing peers living lavish lifestyles ignited jealousy and negative judgments: "They're just spending their father's money," I'd rationalize. Despite understanding that comparison is a natural human impulse, breaking free from it required conscious effort. I learned authenticity was my strongest weapon—being true to myself rather than chasing someone else's highlight reel.

Taking social media breaks provided moments of deep clarity. Away from endless scrolling, I focused on personal growth, meaningful relationships, and introspection. These breaks revealed the depth of my thoughts, desires, and the life I genuinely wanted to live.

Social media algorithms cleverly feed into our preferences, quickly becoming addictive traps. Starting with harmless cooking tutorials, I’d soon spiral into watching irrelevant, dopamine-heavy content. Algorithms initially seem helpful but often lead to wasted time and deeper addiction, reinforcing endless scrolling habits.

Yet, despite the loneliness, social media enabled genuine friendships. Online gaming introduced me to real connections built on mutual interests, even though we'd never met physically. Still, nothing replaced face-to-face interactions, sharing food, laughter, and real human touch. Digital friendships fulfilled intellectual and emotional needs, but physical friendships provided deeper, tangible bonds.

**Actively interacting—commenting, messaging—rather than passively scrolling, dramatically changed my experience.** Initially shy, I quietly scrolled, feeling invisible and disconnected. Once I started engaging actively, people noticed me. My presence was acknowledged through interactions, creating a sense of belonging and reducing loneliness. This realization led me to create anonymous accounts for safe interactions, allowing me to genuinely connect without risking personal vulnerability. Secretly connecting with a popular influencer validated my existence online, reducing the feeling of isolation.

Each social media platform evokes different emotions. Twitter's open, judgment-free nature appeals to me, fostering direct communication and genuine discussions. Conversely, LinkedIn feels superficial—filled with polished profiles and insincere interactions designed to impress rather than genuinely connect. Authenticity seems rare, often overshadowed by efforts to look good professionally rather than form meaningful relationships.

Ultimately, the constant pressure to present polished versions of ourselves online made me yearn for raw, honest interactions. Creating this blog became my refuge—a place where authenticity mattered, a space for real, relatable stories free from judgment or pretense.

Social media undoubtedly amplifies loneliness, particularly among Gen Z. Physical play, genuine interactions, and traditional relationships diminish as digital interactions replace them. Dating apps replace organic relationships, causing fragile bonds and frequent heartbreaks. Parents push technology onto children, unintentionally increasing isolation. AI, while impressive, further reduces the need for human interaction, making loneliness the hidden cost of technological progress.

**If I built a social network, authenticity and genuine connection would be its core.** Friends would connect physically or locally, with interactions requiring proximity—real-world meetings encouraged through technology, not replaced by it. Real connections would generate points, incentivizing genuine interactions. This dream social network would cut distractions, encouraging authenticity above popularity or superficial metrics.

My only regret is not starting this blog sooner, letting years of anxiety and stress go unaddressed. Writing here, anonymously yet openly, provides the confidence to share my truest self. I don’t know you, but I trust our shared vibes connect us deeply—real, raw, and unfiltered.
