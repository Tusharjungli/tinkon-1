Let’s talk about the system running this country (and honestly, most countries).  
If I look at India in 2025, here’s my honest take—**jobs are the easiest way to control people.**

It’s like this: imagine a bull tied to a rope, just circling in a small area. The bull feels like he’s moving and achieving something, but in reality, he’s just stuck. For us, the government is the one holding the rope.

When you get a job, you’re helping a company grow. In return, you get a salary. The government gets its tax cut, and every rupee you make is tracked—no cheating the system. Then banks come in, offering you credit cards. Sounds great, right? You can buy what you want, whenever you want—at least that’s the dream they sell.

But a credit card is just a loan disguised as “free money.”  
It’s a lifesaver sometimes, sure. But for most people, it’s another trap.

Here’s the reality:  
- Middle-class person lands a job.  
- Gets a credit card.  
- Spends money on things he thinks he needs—iPhones, cars with fancy features he’ll never use, expensive dinners, dream trips.  
- All on EMI.  
- Suddenly, he’s locked in for 5–10 years paying back debt.  
- Now, he can’t just quit his job or change careers, because bills won’t wait.

You get locked into a routine—9 to 5 at work, then spending money on the weekends to “enjoy life,” but really, just to feel okay about the daily grind. It’s a loop you can’t escape easily. I recently saw a breakdown that said you’d need to earn ₹7.5 lakh per month just to “breathe” in Gurgaon. Most of those expenses are unnecessary, but people feel forced to keep up, just to look good in society.

All your life, you work to pay EMIs, thinking that’s progress. But step back and look—what’s really changed?

Here’s what most people miss:  
The system isn’t stupid.  
The government and companies want you on this treadmill. That’s why jobs are easy to find (but hard to leave), why loans are pushed on you, and why brands keep selling you dreams that are always just out of reach.

When a middle-class person gets a job, he’s the perfect customer—for brands and for the government.  
- Brands sell you dreams (on credit).  
- Government gets its tax.  
- Banks profit from your EMIs and late fees.  
- And you’re too tired to fight it, because you need to “keep up.”

Everything is digital now—payments, taxes, your personal data. The government can track you, see your transactions, even access your phone if needed. There’s almost zero privacy, especially in India. Whatever you do online, someone, somewhere, can access it.

And then there’s inflation and taxes, which put even more pressure on people.  
The easiest way out? Get a job, stick with it, pay your EMIs, don’t make trouble. That’s the unwritten rule.

This system has gotten really good at keeping people feeling free, while actually being controlled. You have just enough comfort to not revolt, just enough hope to keep grinding.

Schools and colleges? They don’t teach you how to think.  
They teach you how to pass exams, get degrees, and fit into a company’s mold.  
A middle-class kid grows up, goes to school, crams the same old syllabus, and then heads to college—paying huge fees, often on loan. After graduation, the college promises you a job.  
But that “job-ready” student is just more fuel for the system.

If you want to do something different, the system makes it tough.  
If you want to study further, that’s more debt.  
If you want to try something on your own, the risk feels huge.

It’s like the system wants to keep you just smart enough to do the job, but not enough to question the trap.

**So what’s the solution?**  
This is what I’ve learned, from my own real experience:  
- Your brain and your body are still yours.  
- You can still pause, take a step back, and think for yourself.  
- Learn new skills. Explore.  
- Don’t be afraid to step outside the system—even if it’s scary.

You only get one life. Don’t waste it just ticking boxes for someone else’s dream.

Even if you earn less, even if your journey is slower, live for yourself.  
It’s okay to do a job, to take a loan, to use credit cards—but don’t get stuck in the trap forever.

*Change is inevitable. The system won’t change for you. But you can change yourself.*

I’m building this website for me—not for the government, not for a big brand.  
I’m learning, growing, applying what I know to become better.  
Don’t just chase the dreams brands or companies sell you—think for yourself.  
Your real dream might be very different from what you see in those ads.

**One life. Live it for you.**
