## I 
was born in 2000, and if fate lets me, I’ll leave this world in 2070. Seventy years of being a man. Seventy years of learning that being male in this world has always been a strange combination of strength, silence, and scars.  

When you’re a boy, growing up feels like fun. You run, you laugh, you play. But as you grow, you slowly begin to understand: the world does not wait for you. Life of a man was never soft. Look at history—men fought wars, swung swords, broke bones, carried families on bare shoulders, bled, got killed, and came back with scars deeper than flesh. That was survival then.  

But the times changed. The rules changed. The weapons disappeared, replaced by machines, democracy, and technology. Yet, strangely, the hardship never left.

## The New Battlefield: Inside the Mind  

In 2025, the man’s battlefield is no longer outside—it’s inside his head.  

Our ancestors fought for food, shelter, and land. Today’s man fights for money, status, attention, love, and relevance in a society that won’t stop reminding him that he is never enough.  

He doesn’t wrestle lions. He wrestles depression.  
He doesn’t dodge arrows. He dodges bills, expectations, and constant comparison.  
He doesn’t heal with bandages. He carries wounds invisible to everyone—wounds in the mind that no one bothers to treat.  

When a boy enters his teenage years today, he doesn’t think about hunting or farming. His brain transforms into a pressure cooker of modern demands—earn money, stand out in society, look attractive, get a girlfriend, gain followers, show off success, and never fall behind.  

And if he fails? The world doesn’t forgive.  

## The Weight of Responsibility  

As he grows, the burden grows with him. He must care for parents, siblings, relationships, maybe children—and still, society whispers: *give us more*.  

So he bends his back, working jobs that drain his spirit. Hand jobs. Brain jobs. Corporate slavery. Endless hustle. All just to prove—*I am a man. I am providing.*  

In the past, men ruled with their strength. Today, strength has been replaced by labor, and labor by compliance. He lost control. He became an employee, a servant to paychecks, a puppet to algorithms, and a victim of comparisons.  

The boss owns him.  
Social media mocks him.  
His partner doubts him.  
His kids shame him.  
Society taunts him.  

And through it all, he stays quiet—because that’s what men do.

## The Invisible Wounds  

In history, scars were visible—on arms, on legs, across the chest. People saw them, respected them, and healed them. Today’s scars? They are buried inside his brain. Nobody sees them. Nobody cares.  

Once, a man came home from war and his partner healed him with love so he could rise again the next day. Today, a man comes home from work, and sometimes he finds betrayal instead of comfort. His ability to recover is stolen. His inner wounds rot, unseen.  

But the brain adapts. And so men adapt. They learn to live like no one cares.  

## The Trap of Cheap Happiness  

The modern world offers him something else in bulk—dopamine. Easy pleasure, quick escape. Scroll. Swipe. Drink. Smoke. Watch. Repeat.  

It feels like soothing cream on a burning wound. But soon, it becomes poison. He gets addicted to temporary highs, while the scars inside his mind deepen.

## The Fall of the Strong  

So here we are, in this strange century. Men tortured by expectations. Men stripped of power. Men mocked for being weak, told they’re useless, told they’re replaceable.  

For the first time in history, men are at their lowest state—mentally broken, socially cornered, spiritually empty. And society? It kneels them down further.  

## But Here’s the Truth  

Men are not finished.  

Even at their weakest, men wake up before sunrise, put on their masks, and grind. They carry their families. They hold back their tears. They find strength in caffeine, nicotine, and sheer stubbornness.  

Yes, men are scarred. Yes, men are exhausted. But history shows something undeniable—when men fall, they rise. When men break, they rebuild.  

We are still here. We are still working. We are still standing.  

And if history has taught us anything—it’s that men, no matter how beaten, always find a way to survive.  

So if you are a man reading this, know this truth: **you are stronger than your scars. You are not useless. You are not defeated. You are the proof that survival runs in our blood.**

The world may push us to our knees, but it has never learned one thing about men—**we rise. Always.**
