## The Mark ✅

Hanuman returned to Lanka once again  
this time smaller, quieter, hidden in the form of a sadhu.  

He bowed before Sita and said gently,  
> Mata, give me a sign.  
Something Ram can hold and know that I truly met you.

Sita removed one **bangle** from her hand  
and placed it in Hanuman’s palm.

Then she said words that felt heavier than gold:

> You are powerful.  
Help the helpless.  
Please help me.

She asked Hanuman to remind Ram of **Jayanti**,  
Indra’s son  
to awaken the strength he sometimes forgets while carrying the pain of love.

And then, her voice broke:

> You are leaving.  
How will I survive here alone?

Hanuman folded his hands and replied softly:

> Mata, stay strong for a little longer.  
I will return with Ram.

### ✨ Reflection

> Tulsidas shows Sita as patience.  
> I see her as strength that refuses to give up even when no hope for her.

## The Return of the Messenger

Hanuman rose back into his **true form**  
broad, powerful, shining  
and with a thunderous roar, leapt out of Lanka.

He returned to his brothers  
beat his chest  
and roared again  
In fulfillment.

Everyone knew  
Ram’s work was done.

Without resting, they moved toward Ram.

## Madhuban and the First Celebration

The army reached **Madhuban**, Sugreev’s sacred garden.  
Angad entered without permission  
climbed trees  
ate fruits  
threw them to everyone  
and laughed like a child who knows the mission is complete.

The guards tried to stop him  
but Angad only spread more joy.

When Sugreev heard this, he smiled.

> Only someone who has completed Ram’s work  
> would dare enter Madhuban.

Moments later, the entire monkey army stood before Sugreev  
cheering  
roaring  
celebrating.

When Sugreev learned it was Hanuman  
he hugged him tightly  
no king  
no servant  
only gratitude.

## Ram Meets Hanuman

Ram and Lakshman sat on a high cliff.  
From afar, Ram saw the army approaching.

He stood up.

He asked everyone about their health  
their journey  
their pain.

Jambavan stepped forward and said:

> We are alive only because of Hanuman.

Ram rushed forward  
hugged Hanuman  
and asked with trembling urgency:

> Tell me.  
How is Sita?

Hanuman replied:

> Every moment she chants your name.  
She looks at the ground as if it is your feet.  
And she gave me this.

He placed **Sita’s bangle** in Ram’s hand.

Ram pressed it against his heart.

Hanuman whispered:

> Prabhu, she is in pain.  
Please go and bring her back.

Ram closed his eyes and said quietly:

> She lives inside me.  
No one in Lanka can ease her suffering.

---

### ✨ Reflection

> Love doesn’t scream.  

---

## The Birth of Eternal Service

Ram looked at Hanuman and said:

> Ask me.  
What can I give you in return?

Hanuman looked into Ram’s eyes  
something shifted inside him.

He fell at Ram’s feet and said:

> Let me stay under your umbrella.

Ram tried to lift him  
but Hanuman was too strong  
too heavy to lift.

Finally, Ram embraced him.

From that moment  
Hanuman was no longer just a messenger  
he became **Ram’s servant forever**.

## The Call to War

Hanuman narrated everything  
from Lankini  
to Ashoka Vatika  
to burning Lanka.

Ram listened  
silent  
focused  
resolved.

He called Sugreev.

Orders were given.

Monkeys of every size gathered  
young, old, massive, tiny  
beating chests  
roaring  
ready to give their lives.

They marched toward the ocean.  
The shore filled with vanaras.

War was no longer a thought.  
It became destiny.

## Fear Inside Lanka

In Lanka, people rebuilt burnt homes  
but fear lived inside them.

Mandodari noticed it.

She went to Ravana and said:

> The messenger shook Lanka.  
His master cannot be ordinary.  
Please return Sita.  
I do not want bloodshed.

Ravana laughed.

> Fear is for the weak.

Power had blinded him.

---

## Vibhishan Chooses Dharma

Vibhishan stood before Ravana and said:

> Ram is not ordinary.  
Please turn back.

Ravana mocked him.

Later, in rage, Ravana struck Vibhishan  
humiliated him before all.

Still, Vibhishan pleaded.

But ego won.

That night  
Vibhishan left Lanka.

---

## The Man Who Walked Toward Light

When Vibhishan approached the ocean shore where Ram's army resting.  
monkeys panicked.

Sugreev asked Ram:

> What should we do?

Ram replied calmly:

> Bring him to me.

When Vibhishan saw Ram  
he froze.

This was the image from his dreams  
exactly as Hanuman described.

A king  
a protector  
a force of dharma.

And with that  
Vibhishan chose Destiny.
