This topic is something you can call illegal to talk about—because it’s still banned in many countries, and most people just see it as a drug. A medical drug, which is actually way better than alcohol and cigarettes. After learning about it, I can say it’s more like a life-saving remedy.

*What if I told you that a chemical similar to cannabis is already present in almost every mammal's body? Cannabis is not new to the world—it’s been around forever.*

## What Happens When You Take Cannabis?

Cannabis (or marijuana) gets into your brain as fast as 30 seconds, depending on how you deliver it (smoke, pill, drink, etc). It usually takes 30–60 minutes to peak, and its effects last 3–4 hours. If you’re curious, after you take it, cannabis can stay in your brain’s fatty tissues for up to 80 days.

For some, cannabis gives a good mood, enhanced focus, and makes you more (or less) talkative. Some people get anxiety from it. It all depends on your brain, genes, and medical history. But generally, cannabis increases focus—which is why you see rappers, lyricists, and creative people smoking: it helps them get “in the zone.”

## How It Works: The Science, Simply

Let’s break it down in plain language.  
There are two main things in the brain:  
- One part is always alert (fight or flight mode),  
- The other tries to keep things calm.

When you face something stressful (like your first job interview), your heart races, you sweat, your legs shake—that’s your body’s alert state. At the same time, the other part of your brain tries to calm you down and bring you back to normal.

With marijuana, it does both, in a weird magical way:  
- It makes your body alert, helping focus,  
- But it also tells your brain “everything’s normal, don’t worry.”

This is why many people feel focused, energetic, and relaxed at the same time. You get a high mood, but still feel in control.  
But for others—especially those with anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, or bad medical history—it can trigger anxiety or even paranoia. So for some, it works; for others, it really doesn’t. It all depends on your brain and history.

## How Much is Safe?

That’s a question with no real answer. It depends on the person. For some, 1 milligram is enough; for others, maybe 5.  
Common side effects you probably know: red eyes, dry mouth, and food cravings.  
Red eyes happen because cannabis reduces water secretion—less eye lubrication. The dry mouth is for the same reason: less saliva, so food tastes bland when you’re high. And yes, it definitely triggers the munchies.

## The Bad Side of Cannabis

No doubt, cannabis is used for pain relief in medicine, but it’s not 100% reliable. It does boost mood (dopamine, endorphins), making it addictive like other drugs.  
When you get addicted and try to quit, withdrawal looks like:  
- Nausea  
- Anger  
- Headache  
- Trouble sleeping  
- Loss of appetite  
- Strange dreams

Long-term? The biggest risk is memory loss—short-term or sometimes long-term, depending on the type and variety (sativa, indica, hybrid). Good news: these usually aren’t permanent. Once you stop, your body slowly returns to normal.

## THC vs. CBD: What’s the Difference?

There are two main things in cannabis:  
- **THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol):** The main psychoactive compound. This is what makes you feel “high.” It triggers dopamine (pleasure, mood).
- **CBD (cannabidiol):** Non-psychoactive. No high, but lots of medical benefits—used for epilepsy, anxiety, chronic pain, better sleep, good mood.

Just like alcohol (which has zero good effects on your body), cannabis can actually help—**if** you use it the right way. It can increase focus for cognitive or creative work. But use it just for fun and it’s easy to get addicted—which is one reason legalization is so controversial.

## The Real Question: Why Is Alcohol Legal but Cannabis Isn’t?

Alcohol, with zero health benefits, is legal almost everywhere.  
Cannabis, a plant with so many medical uses, is still banned in most countries.  
Why?  
Because big powers want to keep the status quo. They offer you legal distractions that keep you “busy” and in the system, while anything that could actually unlock potential is kept locked up.

There are drugs out there (like LSD, which I won’t go deep into here) that can unlock parts of the brain you’ve never felt. LSD has caused zero recorded deaths, and no real overdose risk. Cannabis? Zero percent risk of death. Alcohol? 9% of deaths per year are alcohol-related—and it’s still legal.  
Psychedelics (like cannabis) can rewire your brain in amazing ways, with almost no risk of life-threatening damage.

## Our Bodies Are Made for This

Cannabis isn’t foreign to humans. Almost every mammal naturally produces cannabinoids.  
Some people—like those with autism or other brain differences—may not produce enough and benefit from external cannabis.  
When you take it daily, your body adjusts and depends on it (that’s addiction).  
But when you stop, your body can recover and start making its own cannabinoids again.

 cannabis is banned because it gives you a euphoric effect (thanks, THC). But medically, it’s available in certain forms. CBD—because it doesn’t make you high—is sold as pills, oil, and edibles, helping people with stress, anxiety, sleep, and mood.

## Final Thoughts: Nature, Science, and the System

Cannabis is a natural thing, used for medicine for ages. Its addictive nature makes it tough to manage at a big scale—but it has 0% risk of death and can supercharge focus and productivity.  
With proper education and management, cannabis could be legalized and benefit society. Used right, it’s a medicine; abused, it’s a problem.  
That’s the system: governments promote medical use, but put everyday users in jail. this is not a good management system.
