He wrote it as consequence.  
When patience is misunderstood as weakness.*

## Hunger Became a Signal

After receiving Sita’s permission,  
Hanuman jumped onto the trees of Ashoka Vatika.

Tree to tree.  
Fruit to fruit.

His massive feet shook branches.  
Some demons tried to stop him  
they were crushed underfoot.

Within moments, chaos spread throughout the garden.

But Hanuman did not stop.

The more he ate,  
the stronger he became.

And within minutes,  
**Ashoka Vatika — once a prison for sita became a battlefield.**

---

## The Garden Falls

Trees collapsed.  
Walls cracked.  
Demons fled in fear.

Hanuman roared 
in warning.

Ravana heard.

He sent soldiers.

Hanuman revealed his true form  
vast, radiant and terrifying.

The army fell.

---

## Akshay Kumar Falls

Ravana then sent **Akshay Kumar**,  
with a massive force.

Hanuman uprooted a tree and
beating his chest like monkey.

Some demons were crushed.  
Some thrown into the air.  
Some pinned under roots.

Akshay Kumar was killed.

Lanka trembled.

---

## The Warrior Who Chose Restraint

Ravana now sent **Meghnath (Indrajit)**.

Not to kill  
but to capture the monkey.

The battle was fierce.  
Like two elephants colliding.

Hanuman fought as a monkey fights  
running, climbing, striking, retreating.

Meghnath realized strength alone would not work.

He used the **Brahmastra**.

Hanuman fell 
he was defeated, 
he can stand again, 
but he **chose to honor divine law**.

---


## Bound, Not Broken

Hanuman was tied and dragged through Lanka.

News spread fast:

> A monkey has destroyed Ashoka Vatika.

People gathered.  
Mocked.  
Spat.

Then Hanuman stood before **Ravana**.

Ravana laughed.

> Who sent you?  
> Why are you here?

Hanuman replied calmly:

> The one who killed Khar and Dushan.  
> The one whose wife you stole.  
> That is my king.

He warned Ravana:

> Return Sita.  
> Seek Ram’s shelter.  
> Or face destruction.

Ravana mocked him.

---

## The Decision 

Ravana ordered Hanuman’s death.

But **Vibhishan** intervened:

> Killing a messenger is against dharma.

The court agreed.

So Ravana chose cruelty instead.

> Burn his tail.

Oil. Cloth. More oil. More cloth.  
Even Lanka’s supply was not enough.

Hanuman’s tail was set on fire.

---

## Fire Learns Its Path

Hanuman's pain exploded.

Hanuman broke his bonds.

He leapt.

Roof to roof.  
Tower to tower.

Fire followed his tail.

Lanka burned. 

People ran.  
Prayed.  
Cursed.

Hanuman searched for water.

And finally 

He jumped into the ocean.

Steam rose and 
Fire died.

---

## The Silence 

Hanuman emerged.

Tail intact.

Breathing steady.

He rested.

Lanka stood changed forever.

---

### ✨ Reflection

> Hanuman did not burn Lanka to destroy it.  
> He burned it to send a message:  
> devotion mocked becomes unstoppable force.

---

Hanuman came as a messenger.  
He left as a warning.

The war was no longer distant.

It was inevitable.

Thank you for reading.  


In the next part, Hanuman returns to 
and Ram finally hears Sita’s message.
