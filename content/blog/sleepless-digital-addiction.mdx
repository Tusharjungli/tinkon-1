## 2:47 AM. Still Awake. Again.

No, I’m not working on a billion-dollar idea. I’m just scrolling.  
Mindlessly. Reels, memes, a random rabbit hole about how whales sleep. It’s become my default state.

Not tired. Not rested. Just stuck.

If you're Gen Z like me, you probably get it. We’re not just losing sleep—we’re losing peace.

## Sleep Used to Be Simple

Before I got my own phone, I used to fall asleep watching cartoons and dreaming nonsense. Now, I go to bed with my brain spinning at 300 tabs per second.

I don’t even remember when it started—maybe during exam stress, maybe heartbreak, maybe just boredom—but suddenly, sleeping became something I *had* to force.

And don’t even get me started on people who say:  
> “Just sleep early.”  
Like there's a switch for that.

## My Toxic Routine (You’ll Probably Relate)

- Wake up and grab phone before even opening both eyes.
- Scroll while brushing, on the toilet, while eating.
- Heavy breakfast-lunch combo. Guilt. Sluggishness.
- Afternoon nap or endless YouTube spiral.
- Work, maybe. Phone’s still nearby like a needy best friend.
- Evening = social dopamine. Junk food. Pointless chatter.
- Nightfall: brain starts overthinking.
- Try music. Try scrolling. Try ignoring it.
- 3 AM = sleep, finally (or not).

## Why I Can’t Sleep — And Maybe You Can’t Either

It’s not just the phone.

It’s the FOMO.  
The “What if I miss something?” itch.  
The anxiety of not doing enough.  
The regret of doing too much.  
The comparison game.  
The dopamine loop.

Even when I lie in bed, it’s like my brain refuses to *shut up.*

## What Actually Helped Me (No BS, Just My Truth)

<Quote>
"Sleep isn’t something you do. It’s something you allow."
</Quote>

### 1. **Quit Instagram**  
Deleting it was like quitting sugar. The withdrawal hit hard. But then... silence. Space. I still picked up my phone, but with less chaos inside it.

### 2. **Cut Off Deadweight Friends**  
If you feel drained after talking to someone, maybe stop talking to them. I did. The quiet that followed felt awkward at first—then peaceful.

### 3. **Bad Habit Swaps**  
Smoking → chocolate.  
Alcohol → banana shakes.  
Porn → dating apps (still chaotic, but less damaging).  
Not perfect, but better.

### 4. **Ate Like an Adult (Sometimes)**  
Watched food content obsessively. Got into protein. Didn’t always stick to it, but it made me aware.

### 5. **Home Workouts**  
No gym flex. Just dumbbells and guilt. 10 mins daily. No audience. Just sweat and small wins.

### 6. **Hydration Nation**  
This one’s underrated. Water actually makes you less anxious. Kept bottles everywhere—bedside, desk, bag.

### 7. **Meditation (Eventually Helped)**  
At first, it felt fake. Then, I started treating sleep like meditation: no judgment, just presence. Some nights I fail. Some nights I pass out like a stone. Still counts.

## What Changed in Me

I still sleep late sometimes.  
But now, I *care* about rest.

My new rituals:

- No phone for 30 minutes after waking.  
- Water → sunlight → walk.  
- Minimal screen in bed.  
- Journal when the brain screams.  
- Meditate, or at least pretend to.  
- Let go. Let it be.  
- Sleep happens.

And when it doesn’t, I don’t freak out. I just breathe.

## A Real Message to Anyone Awake Right Now

If you're still reading this at 3 AM…  
No shame. I’ve been you. I *am* you.

But let me say this loud:

> Sleep isn’t weak. It’s your foundation.  
> You want clarity, creativity, strength, peace? You need sleep.

No phone app, no “night mode,” no quick fix replaces rest.  
Put your phone down after this blog. Not because I said so—but because your mind deserves the quiet.

## TL;DR (If You're Too Tired)

- Gen Z isn’t lazy—we’re overstimulated.
- Phones aren’t evil, but they’re addictive.
- Rest isn’t a trend—it’s survival.
- If you can’t sleep, don’t shame yourself. Start somewhere. Small.
- You’re not broken. The world is just loud.

And hey, read one more of my [blogs](/blog/30-days-no-instagram) if you can’t sleep yet. Then log off.
