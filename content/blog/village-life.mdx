When I think about city life and village life first thing come into mind is air. In city at morning you hear sound of vehicles, people rushing to office, you see very less greenery near you. You just wake up from bed late because you slept under AC. You just created a sleeping environment for you—the artificial environment before sleeping—whereas in village, the nature automatically wakes you up early no matter you want to wake up or not. There is sound of different birds, sound of animals, you see only farm lands and people coming back or going to their farms because they wake up early and do things early in morning. You can clearly see the difference in morning air in city and village. There is natural environment already made by nature that is under the stars. You don’t need to do anything special for that. I can see the image of me waking up in my village home early morning from terrace. Also I can see my city room when I wake up here.

No doubt city provides many facilities but it have some cost. I was born and brought up in city that is close to village and that's why I got both experience as a child and I see people in city paying hefty amount just to make their space feel like village. They bought a space in city which is already very expensive and then build it like a private space with no air to enter and to feel like home they install plants inside that house, they made a artificial grass land inside their house, they made a private walking space that feel like they are walking on bare land and they just spend on it very large amount which they get for free or very less cost in village.

You may know about it. But in India Cow dung is very auspicious and having very good space in Hindu Religion and of course it’s free because it’s kind of cow’s excreta but you don’t believe cow dung sold in metro cities in exchange of money. From this you can imagine that for this small thing that is free in villages and you can get that anywhere in any village. City people are paying for it. Kids living in city never get to know about it because from starting they see their parents purchasing cow dung and its not free.

Village is open space. People know each other and if not they for sure know about your grandparents. They are kind of small family that is connected in some way and city people these days not know who live 2 blocks far from their house and this thing is normal and city people call it privacy. They don’t want to interfere in someone else’s life that's why they don’t know that. This is now normal and city kids also learning that and in future they are treat with their neighbours same.

## Animals & Bonds

In village animals are like family members. Like cow, buffalo, dogs etc because they were there always with their family and they connects them with a bond and I think city people are learning this thing that how an animal can be a good bond and its good thing people are adopting animals just to create a family like bond.

City kids not know how it feel like to sleep in open air. Because the air quality was so bad that it is not preferable to sleep in open air and they always sleep in closed space and they never going to know how it feel like to wake up early without an alarm. They never get to know that nature already have its alarm.

## Festivals & Community

I see that these days festivals are limited as people in their society in city not know each other and therefore their life and festival get shrink to their small flats and they just do some lightings and eat some outside food and click pictures and that’s it. This is end of festival but in villages there is whole village celebrating. There were sweets all over the village. Lightings all over the village. If you need something on that occasion you can get that for free. The celebration is quite longer than city’s.

## Childhood & Lessons

My childhood mostly spent in city because my parents think that city taught me how to get in discipline. How to stay above uncivilised people. I still remember getting dirty during playing in childhood or exploring things far from my house were bad for me because I know I am crossing the limits but then when I saw village people their kids explore every kind of things they get dirty they play in mud they play with animals and they in their early days already explored whole village because their mother know how important to get in touch with mud even if they get dirty. Their mother knew that whole village is like a family and somehow her child get back after playing and learning new things and meeting new people.

Kids in villages easily communicate with people because they are exploring without any fear. Whereas city kids are not allowed to cross their society’s boundary and that society that was made of concrete and no mud land to play in mud for kids. There were restriction in playing in city because  city is civilized area and getting dirty means you are from uncivilized family. Kids only learn from school teacher in school and there were only their parents and  teachers whom they connected in their childhood because they are going to be a civilized man in future.

In village everyone is your teacher except school teacher and parents because kids adapt things easily outside their zone. For example you see that when a kid learn to play cricket with the help of a teacher he not get hurt easily because his teacher taught him good tricks to play and he learns that like a book lesson whereas you left your kid with other kids without a teacher he learnt to play by getting hurt and he learnt the same things but with hurting experience that he never forgets. I learnt things by experience that life taught me because no one teaches you how to live life in village.

## Neighbours & Dependence

As a kid brought up in city I never get to my neighbour to get something to borrow because it not feel good in city. But living in village sometime you cannot live without borrow. You have to depend on milk or dairy products on nearby people, you have to depend on vehicle, water, electricity almost every daily need somehow you have to depend on neighbour and if you think you purchase everything from money still people can borrow from you and so there is no chance to live without neighbour there. That’s I learnt there early.

Village life taught me to live and breathe in open air and in open space. In city I see houses, vehicles, buildings, people crying for jobs, surviving in city and I mean to say not that happy. In village the life is worst that city. People only have enough food to survive, no fancy life, no or minimum electricity but they have open and free life. They know they have roof, clothes and food to eat at last and they are happy in that. They are independent. They know they can grow crops enough to survive.

Village life taught me real meaning of animal love. I remember an old woman in my village sleeps with her cow every night no matter its cold or summer. She had that cow since that cow was born and that cow only give her milk and nothing more. That old woman wakes up early and go on a walk with her cow and I use to watch her daily coming back at my village home asking for food (cow) and I love to feed her. But few days ago I get to know that old woman and her cow both dies due to old age. That’s I learn the real meaning of animal bond and love.

## Modern Childhood

City kids only playing video games and plays outdoor game only in some school or some sports playground after paying fees for that. They always play in safe zone and never get into extreme environment from there they get to know the real games how can be played. Their friendship only limited to social media. They made friends in school and that’s it and after that they only connected with social media and later they only make friends in LinkedIn or some fake friends just to lick their asses and that way they are lonelier as they get older. Because it’s in their upbringing to stay with new tech and stay safe. Then I think the Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the safest kids in the history.

City kids actually learn to fake things. How to get job ready. How to get fake happy. How to get likes on Instagram. How to look happy when you go into a restaurant. They are developing their brain to get fit into society culture. Because they are not getting enough exposure in city. In city or actually in metro city everyone wants to be stand out and they can do anything to do that. They buy clothes to look good, they spend money to look rich, they buy expensive cars just to look better. Live everything they spend on just to show them they are civilized and better that others. Because social media has made them to do that. Kids there are learning that from their parents.

I saw kids in city that small kids getting expensive phones and from there they are learning dressing sense from Pinterest or from Instagram and they spreading that to their friends and instead of getting physically and mentally grow their a chunk of brain just learning how to dress better. How to look good in society. Whereas village life as I told you just survive and living happy and there is nothing like looking rich. Because I also saw people who are rich in village living very basic life. They purchase lands, spending on healthy food, investing, travelling and living rest of life playing indoor games with their fellows. That’s how a rich person in village dies. But in city I recently saw a person spending around 8 lakhs per month just to survive in metro city. He giving EMI for the flat he living in. Flat means he don’t own any land just a plane space. He is giving 2 lakhs EMI for that. He purchased expensive car just to drive in traffic and get good air inside their car. He spend hefty amount on his child’s education. He spending money in clubs and restaurant just to look happy and feel rich. Even if they not like the food. Even they spend on drivers, maids and cook. And on name of investing and insurance they have nothing. That is basic metro city living.

## A Real Story

I have an incident when I was in village. A cousin of mine who was 5 years old never visited village and his parents own a big house in city in which they made a playground inside house and almost every facility inside their house so that their kid no need to get outside. That kid never get far from her mother for very long. He was a proper city kid. So he visited village for the first time and there was raining at that time and people in my village doing rain water harvesting and for that they are collecting rain water and that kid see that man and that water like they are doing dirty thing. That kid speaking to that man and saying its tonic water why you collecting it. It can harm your health and that man just drink that rain water and says its God's water and it not harm as it comes straight from mountains. That kid surprised that how can a man drink rain water.

Next that kid saw some kids playing in rainwater that collected on land and when I told him to play with them. He afraid and hide behind me because he never plays in rainwater as according to city's rule its tonic water and if it touches that kid it makes him dirty and harm him. I surprised that on the one hand village kids are enjoying rain and playing and on the other hand my cousin afraid and missing the important things of his childhood.

Another incident was when I took him with me to go for a walk in farm lands and I just played a little game and I hide in farms and he just stood there crying and crying and never stops till I reach home and then her mother told me that he never stays away from her and that's why its hard for him to stay alone. That was so horrible for me. I am like how can he survive without his mother when he grows up. He need to stay out in real world. Also, he never gets to sleep without AC in his house. This is horrible experience for me.

## What I Wish For

I want city kids to live at least a month in village to experience real life and happiness that is away from city. I want city kid to stay with village kid and play their summer vacation with them. Get dirty, play around people, eat food with dirt hands, meet with people, explore village with friends, run in farms, eat raw food straight from trees, climb some trees, jump into river, drink raw water and they get to know what independence really is. What real childhood means. Spend some time with their grandparents in village. They for sure will never forget what village life is what real fun is.

There is this misconception that kid and their parents feel that village is staying behind and only uneducated people and poor people live there. They feel like village is some uncivilized place to live. But in reality village is richest place from life and money's perspective. Village is real independence. People buying 3 crore flat in city whereas in village people buy a huge land in 3 crores that is way bigger than these flats. In city people have to follow rules if they don’t want to still they have to follow. In village there are rules made by themselves and they are following themselves. No outsider. In city everything govern by some outer government who wants globalization and money.

## My Heart

I was most of my time in city and my brain trained in city like I have to follow rules, live like a civilized man and this is all independence you have but when I grow and started living some time with my grandparents I get to know independence really is in village. There were no traffic, air was free, quite silence, people enjoying and gathering, taking care of each other even if they don’t want to. Living and sleeping under the tree after working in farms. The calmness and no rule. It really feels different for me at starting but later I realize this is real happiness and independence.

It really helps my mental health to forget city sometime and sit under the tree in a totally calm farm land and feel air. And when I stay under the tree thinking more and playing with my brain more and noticing things more and it also helps me with creativity. But sad thing is after my grandmother dies my family had to leave village and now there is very less visit in village and I really miss village life. But in future I try to live this experience once again. I miss village life man.

If I could design a perfect childhood. First of all I give that child a open place to see things. A open land where he can play in mud, in rain, with animals, with his fellow friends, I give him enough space to explore things out of his comfort zone, fail, fall and learn. I want him to learn things early and from experience only like without any medicine a person can recover just with nature's help. Putting soil on some minor scratch heal it like a antiseptic. I want him to live raw like old people use to live/survive.

**So, this is from my side.**  
If you read this far, you get it—what city kids miss out on is not just fresh air or playtime, but *a whole philosophy of living free.*
