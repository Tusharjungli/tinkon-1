## The Walk of Repentance

When Bharat and Shatrughan began their journey,  
they refused to ride horses because Ram walked barefoot.  

Seeing them, the entire army followed 
soldiers, queens and even the citizens left their horses too.  

Kaushalya, seated in her palanquin,  
called out gently,  
> Bharat, the people are not as strong as you.  
> Let them ride, and you too must lead from your horse.

Then bharat said okay... just for his people.

## The River of Remembrance

When they reached the same Ganga river where the sailor had once helped Ram cross,  
the sailor saw the massive army and feared  
that perhaps Bharat came to harm Ram and secure his throne.  

He gathered his men, ready for battle,  
until an old sailor stopped him:  
> Don’t fight until you know their purpose.  

The sailor then approached Bharat’s camp  
and introduced himself to Sage Vishistha.  

When Bharat heard the name,  
he immediately got down from his chariot and said,  
> You helped my brother cross the river.  
> I came not to harm him but to fall at his feet. 

The sailor’s eyes softened. He bowed,  
and Bharat embraced him like a brother.  

That night, the sailor king hosted everyone,  
offering food and places to rest.  

---

## The Bed of Ants

Bharat couldn’t sleep.  
He asked the sailor,  
> Show me where Ram, Sita and Lakshman slept.

The sailor led him to a patch of earth under a tree.  
It was rough, covered in sand and small ants.  

Bharat’s eyes filled with tears  
> He was meant to sleep on golden beds in Ayodhya.  
And see where my mother’s ambition brought him.  

He pressed his forehead to the ground,  
as if the soil still carried Ram’s warmth.

### ✨ Reflection

> For Tulsidas, this moment was pure devotion.  
> For me, it’s the kind of pain that comes  
> when you realize your love couldn’t protect the one you loved most.

## The Sage and the Lesson

The next morning, the entire group with Sailor King crossed the Ganga.  
Bharat still walked barefoot,  
refusing every plea to mount a horse.  

> I have wronged my brother.  
> Until I meet him, my feet will stay on ground.

When they reached **Bharadwaj Muni’s Ashram**,  
Bharat was nervous.  
He feared the sage might blame him.  

But Bharadwaj smiled and said,  
> You are blameless, my son.  
> It’s your mother’s act, not yours.  
> Your love for Ram purifies the name of Ayodhya itself.  

The sage’s words brings peace inside Bharat.  
For the first time, his guilt began to turn into strength.  

Bharadwaj then told his students,  
> Feed these travelers.  
> Build them shelter before nightfall. 

Within hours, huts were raised, food was prepared,  
and fire pits glowed through the forest.  
Bharat stayed there for days(Because of Weather),  
learning the greatest lesson of his life  
that love without ego becomes worship.

## The March to Chitrakoot

By March, the air was warmer and the paths clearer.  
The journey toward **Chitrakoot** began again.  
Bharat led barefoot, queens followed in palanquins,  
rishis and villagers walked alongside elephants and horses.  

They saw and met people of small towns and villages near the Yamuna.
They all saw Ram with sita and Lakshman and they helped Bharat and army to show the way ahead.

When they reached the **Yamuna**, they bathed,  
rested and crossed in boats made by the sailor’s men.  

Every step felt like walking closer to Ram.  

---

## The Reunion Approaches

As they neared Chitrakoot,  
Sita felt uneasy a quiet intuition.  
Ram too, sensed something approaching.  

Then a messenger ran to Ram’s hut:  
> A great army is marching toward you!  

Lakshman’s temper flared.  
He gripped his bow and said,  
> So this is what Bharat wanted   
to rule without threat.  
I’ll not let him touch you, brother!  

But Ram placed a calm hand on his shoulder:  
> Lakshman, my brother’s heart is not made for a throne.  
> Let him come and see what he wanted. 

---

## The Meeting at Chitrakoot

When Bharat’s army reached the **Mandakini River**,  
they bathed, prayed and approached the forest.  

As Bharat drew closer,  
his mind battled itself  
> What if Ram rejects me?  
What if he refuses to see my face? 

Still, he walked faster, barefoot and trembling.  

The sailor climbed a rock to search any sign of Ram 
and spotted a clearing beneath a large tree,  
two huts and three figures dressed as ascetics.  

> There, my lord Ram, Sita and Lakshman!

Bharat’s heart skipped.  
When he finally reached the hut,  
Lakshman stood guard with bow in hand.  
Ram sat beside Sita, repairing his bowstring.  

The moment Bharat bowed and whispered, “Ram…”  
Lakshman froze.  
Ram stood instantly and rushed forward   
pulling his brother into an embrace so deep,  
it silenced every voice in the forest.  

Tulsidas writes that even the trees wept that day.  
I believe him.

## The Tears of Reunion

Bharat fell at Ram’s feet, sobbing.  
> I’ve come to bring you home. 

Ram held his shoulders and again hugged him. 
 

Then came the queens, Guru Vishistha and the others.  
Even Kaikeyi stood silently,  
her pride long dissolved in regret.  

Inside the hut, Vishistha spoke after seeing right moment:  
> My son, your father is no more. 

Ram closed his eyes for some seconds.
his strength didn’t break, but his heart did.  
The entire camp cried like Ayodhya had lost Dashrath again.  

---

## The Ashes of a King

Ram with permission of Guru Vashishtha performed the final rites for Dashrath beside Mandakini.  
No one ate or drank for two days.  
The air itself felt heavy with grief.  

Vishistha later said(words of Bharat (Because he wants Ram to be back in kingdom)),  
> Ram, your duty now is to return to the throne. 

But Ram looked at the ground and replied softly,  
> Ayodhya is not empty Bharat rules with my spirit.  
Please, return and protect the people.  
My heart will stay here in the forest.
It's the last promise my father made.  

And so, the brothers held each other again,  
neither winning, neither losing  

Bharat with Ram's Sandles move back to take care of Ayodhya.
Ram move ahead with Sita and Lakshman for their next destination.

### ✨ Reflection

> Tulsidas saw Bharat as the embodiment of selfless devotion.  
> I see him as every soul that learns love isn’t possession..  
> it’s surrender.  

---

## What i Feel

When I finished this part,  
I realized it’s not a story of kings
it’s the story of how love and duty often walk in opposite directions.  

Ram chose truth.  
Bharat chose surrender.
